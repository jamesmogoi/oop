ble, the system proposal. The concept of a requirement is explained, and several categories of requirements are defined. The purpose and structure of the requirements definition statement is outlined. Techniques to elicit requirements are discussed, including interviews, joint application development (JAD) sessions, questionnaires, document analysis, and observation. Finally, several requirements analysis strategies are described to help the analyst discover requirements. OBJECTIVES • Explain the analysis phase of the SDLC. • Describe the content and purpose of the requirements definition statement. • Classify requirements correctly as business, user, functional, or nonfunctional requirements. • Employ the requirement elicitation techniques of interviews, JAD sessions, questionnaires, document analysis, and observation. • Define the role that each requirement elicitation technique plays in determining requirements. • Describe several analysis strategies that can help the analyst discover requirements. 72 Requirements Determination Introduction Part 2 of this textbook focuses on the analysis phase of the SDLC. The work performed in the analysis phase involves expanding the vision described in the system request into a thorough, detailed understanding of exactly what the new system needs to do. As the detailed understanding of what the new system must do evolves, those details will be expressed and documented in several ways, including a detailed requirements definition statement (this chapter), use cases and a process model (Chapter 4), and a data model (Chapter 5). Although the structure of a textbook requires that these topics be presented sequentially, in practice, the systems analyst uses all of the tools and techniques discussed in Chapters 3 through 5 throughout the analysis phase to define, clarify, and document the requirements for the new system. The Analysis Phase The analysis phase is so named because the term analysis refers to breaking a whole into its parts with the intent of understanding the parts’ nature, function, and interrelationships. In the context of the SDLC, the outputs of the planning phase (the system request, feasibility study, and project plan), outline the business goals for the new system, define the project’s scope, assess project feasibility, and provide the initial work plan. These planning phase deliverables are the key inputs into the analysis phase. In the analysis phase, the systems analyst works extensively with the business users of the new system to understand their needs from the new system. The basic process of analysis involves three steps: • Understand the existing situation (the as-is system). • Identify improvements. • Define requirements for the new system (the to-be system). Sometimes the first step (i.e., understanding the as-is system) is skipped or done in a limited manner. This happens when no current system exists, if the existing system and processes are irrelevant to the future system, or if the project team is using a RAD or agile development methodology in which the as-is system is not emphasized. Traditional methods such as waterfall and parallel development (see Chapter 2) typically allot significant time to understanding the as-is system and identifying improvements before moving to capture requirements for the to-be system. Newer RAD and agile methodologies, such as iterative development, system prototyping, throwaway prototyping, and extreme programming (see Chapter 2), focus almost exclusively on improvements and the to-be system requirements, and they devote little time for investigating the current as-is system. Experience shows that it is useful to study the current situation whenever possible. The insights gained from reviewing the existing system can be quite valuable to the project team. To move the users “from here to there,” an analyst needs strong critical thinking skills. Critical thinking is the ability to recognize strengths and weaknesses and recast an idea in an improved form. These skills are needed for the analyst to understand issues and develop new and improved business processes that are supported by information system technologies. These skills are essential in examining the results of requirements discovery and translating those requirements into a concept for the new system. As an example, let us say that a user states that the new system should “eliminate inventory stock-outs.” While this might be a worthy project goal, the analyst needs to think about it critically to formulate the statement in terms of useful requirements. The analyst could first have the users think about circumstances leading to stock-outs (e.g., supplier orders are not placed in a timely way), and then describe the actual business practices that lead to these circumstances for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com The Analysis Phase 73 (e.g., on-hand inventory levels are updated only once a week; delays occur in identifying the best supply source for the items; delays occur in receiving approval of the supply order, etc.). By focusing on correcting these issues, the team is in a better position to develop new business processes that address these concerns. The new requirements will then be based on the issues that truly need to be fixed. In this case, the requirements might include, in part: • The system will update on-hand inventory levels twice per day. • The system will produce an out-of-stock notification immediately when an item quantity on hand reaches the item reorder point. • The system will include a recommended supplier with every out-of-stock notification. • The system will produce a supply purchase order that is sent to the appropriate manager for approval. • The system will send an approved supply purchase order to the supplier via secure electronic communication. As this example demonstrates, it is unrealistic to expect the true requirements to be delivered on a silver platter during a few conversations with the business users. The analyst must be prepared to dig into the situation and discover requirements. This is rarely an easy process. A number of techniques and tools can be used by the analyst to facilitate this process of discovering requirements. In this chapter, we will describe those techniques and tools so that you can learn how to use them during the analysis phase. We will also explain the critical role that requirements play in defining the new system. As mentioned above, the analyst also employs additional tools during this phase to clarify and document the to-be system concept. These tools are the subject of complete chapters: use cases and the process model (Chapter 4) and the data model (Chapter 5). The final deliverable of the analysis phase is the system proposal, a document compiling the detailed requirements definition statement, use cases, process models, and data model together with a revised feasibility analysis and work plan. At the conclusion of the analysis phase, the system proposal is presented to the approval committee, usually in the form of a system walkthrough. The goal of the walk-through is to explain the system in moderate detail so that the users, managers, and key decision makers clearly understand it, can identify any needed modifications, and are able to decide about whether the project should continue. Before moving into the design phase, the project’s business value should be reviewed to ensure it remains positive. If approved, the system proposal components (requirements definition, use cases, process model, and data model) are used as inputs to the steps in the design phase, which further refine them and define in much more detail how the system will be built. The line between the analysis and design phases is very blurry because the deliverables created in the analysis phase are really the first step in the design of the new system. Many of the major design decisions for the new system are found in the analysis deliverables. In fact, a better name for the analysis phase would really be “analysis and initial design,” but because this name is rather long and because most organizations simply call this phase “analysis,” we will, too. Nonetheless, it is important to remember that the deliverables from the analysis phase are really the first step in the design of the new system. In many ways, determining requirements is the single-most critical aspect of the entire SDLC. Although many factors contribute to the failure of systems development projects, failing to determine the correct requirements is a primary cause.1 A 2014 survey of IT executive managers found 1For example, see Kweku Ewusi-Mensah, Software Development Failures: Anatomy of Failed Projects, MIT Press, 2003. 74 Requirements Determination that “clear statements of requirements” was one of the top project success factors (following “user involvement” and “executive management support”).2 Therefore, analysts should devote considerable attention to the work performed in the analysis phase. It is here that the major elements of the system first begin to emerge. If the requirements are later found to be incorrect or incomplete, significant rework may be needed, adding substantial time and cost to the project. During requirements determination, the to-be system concept is easy to change because little work has been done yet. As the system moves through the subsequent SDLC phases (design and implementation), it becomes harder and harder to return to requirements determination and make major changes because of all the rework that is involved. Therefore, the iterative approaches of many RAD and agile methodologies are so effective—small batches of requirements can be identified and implemented in incremental stages, allowing the overall system to change and evolve over time. Also, methodologies such as the V-model stress that tests for the system should be defined while the requirements are being defined. That way, testing is not just a last-minute, thrown-together process, but instead is based directly on the requirements of the system as they are being defined. Requirements Determination Requirements determination is performed to transform the system request’s high-level statement of business requirements into a more detailed, precise list of what the new system must do to provide the needed value to the business. This detailed list of requirements is supported, confirmed, and clarified by the other activities of the analysis phase: creating use cases and building process and data models. We first explain what a requirement is and discuss the process of creating a requirements definition statement. What Is a Requirement? A requirement is simply a statement of what the system must do or what characteristics it needs to have. During a systems development project, requirements are created that provide different perspectives. For example, we may describe what the business needs (business requirements); what the users need to do (user requirements); what the software should do (functional requirements); characteristics the system should have (nonfunctional requirements); and how the system should be built (system requirements). Although this list of requirement categories may seem intimidating at first, the categories merely reflect the purpose of the requirements and the stage in the SDLC in which they are defined. We have already discussed the creation of the systems request in the planning phase of the SDLC. In the systems request, there are statements that describe the reasons for proposing the systems development project. These statements reflect the business requirements that this system, if built, will fulfill. These business requirements help define the overall goals of the system and help clarify the contributions it will make to the organization’s success. Examples of business requirements include: “Provide product search capabilities,” “Produce performance reports,” “Provide accurate project status reports,” and “Provide account access to mobile customers.” When the systems development project is complete, success will be measured by evaluating whether the stated business requirements have been achieved; therefore, they provide the overall direction for the project. During the analysis phase, requirements are written from the perspective of the business, and they focus on what the system needs to do to satisfy business user needs. A good starting place 2The Standish Report (2014). for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Requirements Determination 75 is to concentrate on what the user really needs to accomplish with the system to fulfill a needed job or task. These user requirements describe tasks that the users perform as an integral part of the business’ operations, such as: “Schedule a client appointment”; “Place a new customer order”; “Re-order inventory”; “Determine available credit”; and “Reconcile supplier shipment.” Use cases (discussed in Chapter 4) are tools used to clarify the steps involved in performing these user tasks. By understanding what the user needs to do to complete a task, the analyst can then determine ways in which the new system can support the users’ needs. The system’s functional requirements evolve from understanding how the new system can support user needs. A functional requirement relates directly to a process the system should perform as a part of supporting a user task and/or information it should provide as the user is performing a task. The International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA) defines functional requirements as “the product capabilities, or things that a product must do for its users.”3 Functional requirements begin to define how the system will support the user in completing a task. For example, assume the user requirement is “Schedule a client appointment.” The functional requirements associated with that task include: “Find available openings matching client availability,” “Select desired appointment,” “Record appointment,” and “Confirm appointment.” Notice how these functional requirements expand upon the user’s task to describe capabilities and functions that the system will need to include, allowing the user to complete the task. As the analyst works with the business users of the system to discover user and functional requirements, the user may reveal processes that will be needed or information that will be needed. For example, as shown in Figure 3-1, the user may state “The system must retain customer order history for 3 years” (an information need). The analyst should probe for the reasoning behind this statement, such as “The system should allow registered customers to review their own order history for the past 3 years” (a process need). Similarly, the user may state “The system should check incoming customer orders for inventory availability” (a process need). An alert analyst will recognize the related information need, “The system should maintain real-time inventory levels at all warehouses.” All of these requirements are necessary to fully understand the system that is being developed. One of the most common mistakes made by new analysts is to confuse functional and nonfunctional requirements. Pretend that you received the following list of requirements for a sales system: Requirements for the proposed system: The system should . . . 1. be accessible to Web users. 2. include the company standard logo and color scheme. 3. restrict access to profitability information. 4. include actual and budgeted cost information. 5. provide management reports. 6. include sales information that is updated at least daily. 7. have 2-second maximum response time for predefined queries and 10-minute maximum response time for ad hoc queries. 8. include information from all company subsidiaries. 9. print subsidiary reports in the primary language of the subsidiary. 10. provide monthly rankings of salesperson performance. Questions 1. Which requirements are functional business requirements? Provide two additional examples. 2. Which requirements are nonfunctional business requirements? What kind of nonfunctional requirements are they? Provide two additional examples. YOUR TURN 3-1 Identifying Requirements 3International Institute of Business Analysis, Guide to Business Analysis Body of Knowledge® (BABOK®), 2nd ed. 76 Requirements Determination Process models (Chapter 4) are used to explain the relationship of functions/processes to the system users, how the functions/processes relate to each other, how data are entered and produced by functions/processes, and how functions/processes create and use stored data. Process models help clarify the software components that will be needed to accomplish the functional requirements. In addition, the information-oriented functional requirements begin to define the data that must be kept track of to accomplish the user tasks. The data component of the system is defined in the data model (Chapter 5). User, functional, and nonfunctional requirements identified in the analysis phase will flow into the design phase, where they evolve to become more technical, describing how the system will be implemented. Requirements in the design phase reflect the developer’s perspective, and they usually are called system requirements. These requirements focus on describing how to create the software product that will be produced from the project. More will be said about system requirements in Part 3 of the textbook. Before we continue, we want to stress that it can be difficult to draw a black-and-white dividing line between these requirement categories. To add to the confusion, some companies use the terms interchangeably and do not distinguish between the types of requirements at all. The important thing to remember is that a requirement is a statement of what the system must do. The focus of requirements changes over time as the project moves from planning to analysis to design to implementation. Requirements evolve from broad overall goal statements to detailed statements of the business capabilities that a system should provide to detailed technical statements of the way in which the capabilities will be implemented in the new system. The final category of requirements is nonfunctional requirements. The IIBA defines this group of requirements as “the quality attributes, design, and implementation constraints, and external interfaces which a product must have.”4 Although the term “nonfunctional” is not very descriptive, this requirement category includes important behavioral properties that the system must have. For example, the ability to access the system through a mobile device would be considered a nonfunctional requirement. Nonfunctional requirements take center stage in the design phase when decisions are made about the user interface, the hardware and software, and the system’s underlying architecture. (We will revisit them in Chapter 7.) Many of these requirements will be discovered during interactions with users in the analysis phase, however, and should be recorded as they are identified. Figure  3-2 lists different kinds of nonfunctional requirements and examples of each kind. Notice that the nonfunctional requirements describe a variety of system characteristics: operational, performance, security, and cultural and political. These characteristics do not describe Functional Requirement Description Examples Process-oriented A process the system must perform; a process the system must do • The system must allow registered customers to review their own order history for the past 3 years. • The system must check incoming customer orders for inventory availability. • The system should allow students to view a course schedule while registering for classes. Information-oriented Information the system must contain • The system must retain customer order history for 3 years. • The system must include real-time inventory levels at all warehouses. • The system must include budgeted and actual sales and expense amounts for the current year and 3 previous years.

For example, the project team needs to know whether a system must be highly secure, requires sub-second response time, or must reach a multilingual customer base. The goal at this point is to identify any major issues. In addition, if the methodology in use includes developing test plans during analysis, then these requirements will be important in establishing testing benchmarks that will be needed later. Nonfunctional Requirement Description Examples Operational The physical and technical environments in which the system will operate • The system will run on Android mobile devices. • The system should be able to integrate with the existing inventory system. • The system should be compatible with any Web browser. Performance The speed, capacity, and reliability of the system • Any interaction between the user and the system should not exceed 2 seconds. • The system downloads new status parameters within 5 minutes of a change. • The system should be available for use 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. • The system supports 300 simultaneous users from 9–11 a.m.; 150 simultaneous users at all other times.

I once worked on a consulting project in which my manager created a requirements definition without listing nonfunctional requirements. The project was then estimated based on the requirements definition and sold to the client for $5,000. In my manager’s mind, the system that we would build for the client would be a very simple standalone system running on current technology. It should not take more than a week to analyze, design, and build. Unfortunately, the client had other ideas. They wanted the system to be used by many people in three different departments, and they wanted the ability for any number of people to work on the system concurrently. The technology they had in place was antiquated, but nonetheless they wanted the system to run effectively on the existing equipment. Because we did not set the project scope properly by including our assumptions about nonfunctional requirements in the requirements definition, we basically had to do whatever they wanted. The capabilities they wanted took weeks to design and program. The project ended up taking 4  months, and the final project cost was $250,000. Our company had to pick up the tab for everything except the agreed upon $5,000. This was by far the most frustrating project situation I ever experienced.   Concepts in Action 3-A What Can Happen If You Ignore Nonfunctional Requirements 78 Requirements Determination The Process of Determining Requirements Both business and IT perspectives are needed to determine requirements during the analysis phase. Systems analysts may not understand the true business needs of the users, while the business users may not be aware of promising new technologies. Therefore, the most effective approach is to have both businesspeople and analysts working together to determine requirements. In fact, the analysis phase involves significant interactions with people who have an interest in the new system (often called stakeholders). One of the first tasks for the analyst is to identify the primary sources of requirements, including the project sponsor, project champion(s), all users of the system (both direct and indirect), and possibly others. It is important that all user perspectives are included. The analyst must also consider how best to elicit the requirements from the stakeholders. There are a variety of elicitation techniques that can be used to acquire information, including interviews, questionnaires, observation, joint application development (JAD, as it is more commonly known), and document analysis. We will discuss these techniques in the next section. The information gathered by these techniques is critically analyzed and used to craft the requirements definition statement. The analyst works with the entire project team and the business users to verify, change, and complete the list of requirements and, if necessary, to prioritize the importance of the requirements that are identified. During this process, use cases, process models, and data models may be used to clarify and define the ideas for the new system. This process continues throughout the analysis phase, and the requirements definition evolves over time as new requirements are identified and as the project moves into later phases of the SDLC. Beware, the evolution of the requirements definition must be carefully managed. Keeping the requirements list tight and focused is a key to project success. The project team cannot keep adding new items to the requirements definition or the system will keep growing and growing and never gets finished. Instead, the project team carefully identifies requirements and evaluates which ones fit within the system scope. When a requirement reflects a real business need but is not within the scope of the current system or current release, it should be evaluated in terms of its importance and impact on time and budget. It may be that the requirement is essential enough to add to the current project, along with appropriate adjustments to the project budget and time frame. We should expect that the requirements may change. However, sometimes requirements are deferred or given a low priority. The management of requirements (and system scope) is one of the hardest parts of managing a project! The Requirements Definition Statement The requirements definition statement—usually just called the requirements definition—is a straightforward text report that simply lists the functional and nonfunctional requirements in an outline format. For example, the DrōnTeq IS department prepared a requirements definition statement when the current Drone Sales System was developed several years ago. Figure 3-3 shows the partial contents of this document. As shown in Figure 3-3, requirements are typically identified by numbering. Assigning unique numbers enables each requirement to be tracked through the entire development process. For clarity, the requirements are typically grouped into functional and nonfunctional groupings. Then, within each of those groups, they are classified further by the type of requirement or by business area. Sometimes, requirements are prioritized on the requirements definition statement. They can be ranked as having “high,” “medium,” or “low” importance in the new system, or they can be labeled with the version of the system that will address the requirement (e.g., release 1, release 2, release 3). This practice is particularly important with RAD methodologies that deliver requirements in batches by developing incremental versions of the system. for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Requirements Determination 79 The most obvious purpose of the requirements definition is to provide a clear statement of what the new system should do in order to achieve the system vision described in the system request. The use cases, process models, and data models provide additional explanatory content in different formats. A critically important purpose of the requirements definition, however, is to define the scope of the system. The document describes to the analysts exactly what the final system needs to do. In addition, it serves to establish the users’ expectations for the system. Nonfunctional Requirements 1. Operational 1.1 The system should run on tablet devices to be used by salespeople. 1.2 The system should be Web-based and run on any browser. 1.3 The system should connect to printers wirelessly. 2. Performance 2.1 The system should provide response times of 3 seconds or less. 2.2 The system should be updated with new customer orders and drone inventory levels every 5 minutes. 3. Security 3.1 Customer accounts should be maintained securely. 3.2 Only the customization shop supervisor may approve non-standard customizing options. 3.3 Use of each tablet device should be restricted to the salesperson to whom it is assigned. 4. Cultural and Political 4.1 Company policy says that all computer equipment is purchased from Dell. Functional Requirements 1. Drone Sales Management 1.1 The system will enable drone sales order creation. 1.2 The system will determine if the requested drone model is in stock. 1.3 The system will display all available customization options for a specific drone. 1.4 The system will create a final approved sales order. 1.5 The system will prepare a shop work order based on final approved configuration. 1.6 The system will process a customer deposit. 1.7 The system will process a customer final payment. 2. Drone Customization Shop Management 2.1 The system will send a Parts Request for needed drone components on an order to Drone Inventory department. 2.2 The system enables assignment of a work order to a specific technician. 2.3 The system records the arrival of component parts as they arrive in the shop parts room. 2.4 The system notifies the assigned technician when all required components are available for a shop work order. 2.5 The system enables the technician to record work start time on a work order. 2.6 The system allows the technician to record when shop order is completed. 2.7 The system notifies the customer of the order completion. FIGURE 3-3 Sample requirements definition. 80 Requirements Determination If and when discrepancies or misunderstandings arise, the document serves as a resource for clarification. Requirements Elicitation Techniques An analyst is very much like a detective (and business users sometimes are like elusive suspects). He or she knows that there is a problem to be solved and therefore must look for clues that uncover the solution. Unfortunately, the clues are not always obvious (and often are missed), so the analyst needs to notice details, talk with witnesses, and follow leads, just as Sherlock Holmes would have done. The best analysts will thoroughly search for requirements using a variety of techniques and make sure that the current business processes and the needs for the new system are well understood before moving into design. You do not want to discover later that you have key requirements wrong—surprises like this late in the SDLC can cause all kinds of problems. Requirements Elicitation in Practice Before discussing the five requirements elicitation techniques in detail, a few practical tips are in order. First, the analyst should recognize that important side effects of the requirements definition process include building political support for the project and establishing trust and rapport between the project team and the ultimate users of the system. Every contact and interaction between the analyst and a potential business user or manager is an opportunity to generate interest, enthusiasm, and commitment to the project. Therefore, the analyst should be prepared to make good use of these opportunities as they arise during the requirements definition process. Second, the analyst should carefully determine who is included in the requirements definition process. The choice to include (or exclude) someone is significant; involving someone in the process implies that the analyst views that person as an important resource and values his or her opinions. You must include all the key stakeholders (the people who can affect the system or who will be affected by the system). This might include managers, employees, staff members, and even some customers and suppliers. Also, be sensitive to the fact that some people may have significant influence within the organization even if they do not rank high in the formal organizational hierarchy. If you do not involve a key person, that individual may feel slighted, causing problems during implementation (e.g., saying “I could have told them this might happen, but they didn’t ask me!”). Finally, do everything possible to respect the time commitment that you are asking the participants to make. The best way to do this is to be fully prepared and to make good use of all the types of requirements elicitation techniques. Although, as we will see, interviewing is the most used technique, other indirect methods may help the analyst develop a basic understanding of the business domain so that the direct techniques are more productive. In general, a useful strategy for the analyst to employ is to begin requirements gathering by interviewing senior managers to gain an understanding of the project and get the “big picture.” These preliminary interviews can then be followed by document analysis and, possibly, observation of business processes to learn more about the business domain, the vocabulary, and the as-is system. More interviews may then follow to collect the rest of the information needed to understand the as-is system. In our experience, identifying improvements is commonly done through JAD sessions because these sessions enable the analysts, users, and other key stakeholders to work together and create a shared understanding of the possibilities for the to-be system. Occasionally, these JAD sessions are followed by questionnaires sent to a much larger group of users or potential users to get a broad range of opinions. The concept for the to-be system is frequently developed through interviews with senior managers, followed by JAD sessions with users of all levels, to make sure that the key requirements of the new system are well understood. for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Requirements Elicitation Techniques 81 In this section, we focus on the five most common requirements elicitation techniques: interviews, JAD sessions, questionnaires, document analysis, and observation. Interviews The interview is the most common requirements elicitation technique. After all, it is natural— usually if you need to know something, you ask someone. In general, interviews are conducted one on one (one interviewer and one interviewee), but sometimes, due to time constraints, several people are interviewed at the same time. There are five basic steps to the interview process: selecting interviewees, designing interview questions, preparing for the interview, conducting the interview, and postinterview follow-up.5 Selecting Interviewees An interview schedule should be created, listing who will be interviewed, the purpose of the interview, and where and when it will take place (Figure 3-4). The people who appear on the interview schedule are selected based on the analyst’s information needs. The project sponsor, key business users, and other members of the project team can help the analyst find the best candidates to provide important information about requirements. People at different levels of the organization will have different viewpoints on the business area. It is important to include both managers who oversee the processes and staff who perform the processes to gain both high-level and low-level perspectives. Also, the kinds of interview subjects that you need may change over time. For example, at the start of the project, the analyst has a limited understanding of the as-is business process. It is common to begin by interviewing one or two senior managers to get a strategic view and then move to mid-level managers who can provide broad, overarching information about the business process and the expected role of the system being developed. Once the analyst has a good understanding of the big picture, lower-level managers and staff members can fill in the exact details of how the process works. Like most other things about systems analysis, this is an iterative process—starting with senior managers, moving to mid-level managers, then staff members, back to mid-level managers, and so on, depending upon what information is needed along the way. It is quite common for the list of interviewees to grow, often by 50–75%. As you interview people, you likely will identify more information that is needed and additional people who can provide the information.

Closed-ended questions require a specific answer. You can think of them as being like multiple-choice or arithmetic questions on an exam (Figure 3-5). Closed-ended questions are used when the analyst is looking for specific, precise information (e.g., how many credit card requests are received per day). In general, precise questions are best. For example, rather than asking “Do you handle a lot of requests?” it is better to ask, “How many requests do you process per day?” Closed-ended questions enable analysts to control the interview and obtain the information they need. However, these types of questions do not uncover why the answer is the way it is, nor do they uncover information that the interviewer does not think to ask ahead of time. Open-ended questions seek a more wide-ranging response from the interviewee. They are similar in many ways to essay questions that you might find on an exam. (See Figure 3-5 for examples.) Open-ended questions are designed to gather rich information and give the interviewee more control over the information that is revealed during the interview. Sometimes the subjects the interviewee chooses to discuss uncover information that is just as important as the answer (e.g., if the interviewee talks only about other departments when asked about problems, it may suggest that he or she is reluctant to admit his or her own department’s problems). Probing questions follow up on what has just been discussed so that the interviewer can learn more. They encourage the interviewee to expand on or to confirm information from a previous In 1990, I led a consulting team for a major development project for the US Army. The goal was to replace eight existing systems used on virtually every Army base across the United States. The as-is process and data models for these systems had been built, and our job was to identify improvement opportunities and develop to-be process models for each of the eight systems. For the first system, we selected a group of mid-level managers (captains and majors) recommended by their commanders as being the experts in the system under construction. These individuals were the first- and second-line managers of the business function. The individuals were experts at managing the process but did not know the exact details of how the process worked.

Many beginning analysts avoid probing questions because they are afraid that the interviewee might be offended at being challenged or because they believe it shows that they did not understand what the interviewee said. When done politely, probing questions can be a powerful tool in requirements discovery. In general, you should not ask questions about information that is readily available from other sources. For example, rather than asking what information is used to perform to a task, it is more effective to show the interviewee a form or report (see document analysis later) and ask what information on it is used. This helps focus the interviewee on the task and saves time, because he or she does not need to describe the information in detail—he or she just needs to point it out on the form or report. Your interview questions should anticipate the type of information the interviewee is likely to know. Managers are often somewhat removed from the details of daily business processes and so might be unable to answer questions about them, whereas lower-level staff members could readily respond. Conversely, lower-level employees may not be able to answer broad, policyoriented questions, while managers could. Since no one wants to appear ignorant, avoid confounding your interviewees with questions outside their areas of knowledge. No type of question is better than another, and usually a combination of questions is used during an interview. At the initial stage of an IS development project the as-is process can be unclear, so the interview process begins with unstructured interviews, interviews that seek a broad and roughly defined set of information. In this case, the interviewer has a general sense of the information needed, but few closed-ended questions to ask. These are the most challenging interviews to conduct because they require the interviewer to ask open-ended questions and probe for important information “on the fly.” As the project progresses, the analyst comes to understand the business process much better, and he or she needs specific information about how business processes are performed (e.g., exactly how a customer credit request is approved). At this time, the analyst conducts structured interviews in which specific sets of questions are developed prior to the interviews. There usually are more closed-ended questions in a structured interview than in the unstructured approach. No matter what kind of interview is being conducted, interview questions must be organized into a logical sequence so that the interview flows well. For example, when trying to gather information about the current business process, the analyst will find it useful to move in logical order through the process or from the most important issues to the least important. There are two fundamental approaches to organizing the interview questions: top-down or bottom-up; see Figure 3-6. With the top-down interview, the interviewer starts with broad, general issues and gradually works towards more specific ones. With the bottom-up interview, the interviewer starts with specific questions and moves to broad questions. In practice, analysts mix the two approaches, starting with broad general issues, moving to specific questions, and then back to general issues. The top-down approach is an appropriate strategy for most interviews. (It is certainly the most common approach.) The top-down approach enables the interviewee to become accustomed to the topic before he or she needs to provide specifics. It also enables the interviewer to understand the issues before moving to the details, because the interviewer may not have sufficient information at the start of the interview to ask specific questions. Perhaps most importantly, the top-down approach enables the interviewee to raise a set of big-picture issues before becoming enmeshed in details, so the interviewer is less likely to miss important issues. One case in which the bottom-up strategy may be preferred is when the analyst already has gathered a lot of information about issues and just needs to fill in some holes with details. Or 84 Requirements Determination bottom-up may be appropriate if lower-level staff members feel threatened or are unable to answer high-level questions. For example, “How can we improve customer service?” may be too broad a question for a customer service clerk, whereas a specific question is readily answerable (e.g., “How can we speed up customer returns?”). In any event, all interviews should begin with noncontroversial questions first and then gradually move into more contentious issues after the interviewer has developed some rapport with the interviewee. Preparing for the Interview It is important to prepare for the interview in the same way that you would prepare to give a presentation. You should have an interview plan that lists the topics/issues that you will ask in the appropriate order; anticipates possible answers and provides how you will follow up with them; and identifies segues between related topics. Figure 3-7 shows a typical format for an interview plan and illustrates a helpful way to prepare for an upcoming interview focused on ideas for consultant performance measures from a human resources director. Confirm the areas in which the interviewee has knowledge so you do not ask questions that he or she cannot answer. Review the topic areas, the questions, and the interview plan, and clearly decide which ones have the greatest priority in case you run out of time. In general, structured interviews with closed-ended questions take more time to prepare than unstructured interviews. So, some beginning analysts prefer unstructured interviews, thinking that they can “wing it.” This is extremely dangerous and often counterproductive because any information not gathered in the first interview would have to be obtained by follow-up efforts, and most people do not like to be interviewed repeatedly about the same issues. Be sure to prepare the interviewee as well. When you schedule the interview, inform the interviewee of the reason for the interview and the areas you will be discussing far enough in advance so that he or she has time to think about the issues and organize his or her thoughts. This is particularly important when you are an outsider to the organization and for interviewing lower-level employees who often are not asked for their opinions and who may be uncertain about why you are interviewing them.

You should appear to be professional and an unbiased, independent seeker of information. The interview should start with an explanation of why you are there and why you have chosen to interview the person, and then move into your planned interview questions. It is critical to carefully record all the information that the interviewee provides. In our experience, the best approach is to take careful notes—write down everything the interviewee says, even if it does not appear immediately relevant. Do not be afraid to ask the person to slow down or to pause while you write, because this is a clear indication that the interviewee’s information is important to you. One potentially controversial issue is whether to tape-record the interview. Recording ensures that you do not miss important points, but it can be intimidating for the interviewee. Most organizations have policies or generally accepted practices about the recording of interviews, so find out what they are before you start an interview. If you are worried about missing information and cannot tape the interview, then bring along a second person to take detailed notes. As the interview progresses, it is important that you understand the issues that are discussed. If you do not understand something, be sure to ask. Do not be afraid to ask “dumb questions,” because the only thing worse than appearing “dumb” is to be “dumb” by not understanding something that you could have cleared up by questioning. If you do not understand something during the interview, you certainly will not understand it afterward. Try to recognize and define jargon and be sure to clarify jargon you do not understand. One good strategy to increase your Interviewee: Paul H., Human Resources Director Interview purpose/goals: Understand Paul’s requirements for the new performance measures and reporting of measures to be used to monitor the staff of consultants. Interview strategy: Top-down design. Begin with general discussion of his need for performance measures. Ask open-ended questions about what he is currently missing from the performance measures he has. Explore ideas for new metrics he thinks would help him. Finish with closed-ended questions to confirm understanding of specific metric ideas. Discuss any other areas of concern such as confidentiality issues. Behavioral issues to expect (if any are known): Expect Paul to be supportive and enthusiastic. He has been asking for these improvements for quite a while. Interview topics and outline: General introduction, discuss purpose and goals of meeting Understand his current approach to understanding the performance of consulting staff • Current metrics (if any) • How are these metrics collected and reported (if at all)? • How are these measures inadequate? Ideas for improved performance measures • Develop list of items he thinks would be useful • Understand the underlying data source of each item—need to know exactly what each one means and how the relevant data is or could be collected How would he like to receive these metrics? • Regular reports? If so, how often? • Dashboard? • Queries? Other concerns: • Are metrics confidential? • If yes, identify which ones are confidential and who is allowed to view them. • If no, how widely shared will these metrics be? FIGURE 3-7 Sample interview preparation form. A template for this figure is available on the student website. 86 Requirements Determination understanding during an interview is to periodically summarize the key points that the interviewee is communicating. This avoids misunderstandings and demonstrates that you are listening. Finally, be sure to separate facts from opinion. The interviewee may say, for example, “We process too many credit card requests.” This is an opinion, and it is useful to follow this up with a probing question requesting support for the statement (e.g., “Oh, how many do you process in a day?”). It is helpful to check the facts because any differences between the facts and the interviewee’s opinions can point out key areas for improvement. Suppose that the interviewee complains about a high or increasing number of errors, but the logs show that errors have been decreasing. This suggests that errors are viewed as a particularly important problem that should be addressed by the new system, even if they are declining. As the interview draws to a close, be sure to give the interviewee time to ask questions or provide information that he or she thinks is important but was not part of your interview plan. In most cases, the interviewee will have no additional concerns or information, but in some cases, this will lead to unanticipated, but important information. Likewise, it can be useful to ask the interviewee if there are other people who should be interviewed. Make sure that the interview ends on time. (If necessary, omit some topics or plan to schedule another interview.) As a last step in the interview, briefly explain what will happen next (see the Post-interview Follow-up section). You do not want to prematurely promise certain features in the new system or a specific delivery date, but you do want to reassure the interviewee that his or her time was well spent and extremely helpful to the project. Beginning systems analysts may naively think that conducting an interview is as easy as conversing with a friend. Unfortunately, this is almost never true. Interviewees often are not able or willing to hand over the needed information in a neat, organized fashion. In some cases, they may not want to share what they know at all. Analysts should hone their interpersonal skills to improve their interviewing success. (See Practical Tip 3-1.) Interpersonal skills are those that enable you to develop rapport with others, and they are very important for interviewing. They help you to communicate with others effectively. Some people develop good interpersonal skills at an early age; they simply seem to know how to communicate and interact with others. Other people are less “lucky” and need to work hard to develop their skills. Interpersonal skills, like most skills, can be learned. Here are some tips: • Don’t worry, be happy. Happy people radiate confidence and project their feelings on others. Try interviewing someone while smiling and then interviewing someone else while frowning and see what happens! • Pay attention. Pay attention to what the other person is saying (which is harder than you might think). See how many times you catch yourself with your mind on something other than the conversation at hand. • Summarize key points. At the end of each major theme or idea that someone explains, you should repeat the key points back to the speaker (e.g., “Let me make sure I understand. The key issues are . . .”). This demonstrates that you consider the information important—and also forces you to pay attention. (You cannot repeat what you did not hear.) • Be succinct. When you speak, be succinct. The goal in interviewing (and in much of life) is to learn, not to impress. The more you speak, the less time you give to others. • Be honest. Answer all questions truthfully, and if you do not know the answer, say so. • Watch body language (yours and theirs). The way a person sits or stands conveys much information. In general, a person who is interested in what you are saying sits or leans forward, makes eye contact, and often touches his or her face. A person leaning away from you or with an arm over the back of a chair is disinterested. Crossed arms indicate defensiveness or uncertainty, while “steepling” (sitting with hands raised in front of the body with fingertips touching) indicates a feeling of superiority. PRACTICAL TIP 3-1 Developing Interpersonal Skills for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Requirements Elicitation Techniques 87 Post-interview Follow-up After the interview is over, the analyst needs to prepare an interview report that describes the information from the interview (Figure 3-8). The report contains interview notes, information that was collected over the course of the interview and is summarized in a useful format. In general, the interview report should be written within 48 hours of the interview, because the longer you wait, the more likely you are to forget information. Often, the interview report is sent to the interviewee with a request to read it and inform the analyst of clarifications or updates. Make sure the interviewee is convinced that you genuinely want his or her corrections to the report. Usually, there are few changes, but the need for any significant changes suggests that a second interview will be required. Never distribute someone’s information without prior approval. Early in my consulting career, I was sent to a client organization with the goal of interviewing the only person in the organization who knew how the accounts receivable system worked and developing documentation for that system (nonexistent at the time). The interviewee was on time, polite, and told me absolutely nothing of value about the accounts receivable system, despite my best efforts over several interview sessions. Eventually, my manager called me off this project, and our attempt to document this system was abandoned.   Questions 1. Why do you suppose the interviewee was so uncooperative? 2. Can you think of any ways to avoid this failed outcome?

Summary of Interview: • Sample reports of all current HR reports are attached to this report. The information that is not used and missing information are noted on the reports. • Two biggest problems with the current system are: 1. The data are too old. (The HR department needs information within 2 days of month end; currently information is provided to them after a 3-week delay.) 2. The data are of poor quality. (Often, reports must be reconciled with the HR departmental database.) • The most common data errors found in the current system include incorrect job-level information and missing salary information. Open Items: • Get current employee roster report from Mary Skudrna (extension 4355). • Verify calculations used to determine vacation time with Mary Skudrna. • Schedule interview with Jim Wack (extension 2337) regarding the reasons for data quality problems. Detailed Notes: See attached transcript. FIGURE 3-8 Interview report. A template for this figure is available on the student website. 88 Requirements Determination Joint Application Development (JAD) Joint Application Development (JAD) is an information gathering technique that allows the project team, users, and management to work together to identify requirements for the system. IBM developed the JAD technique in the late 1970s, and it is an especially useful method for collecting information from users.6 Capers Jones claims that JAD can reduce scope creep by 50%, and it prevents the requirements for a system from being too specific or too vague, both of which can cause trouble during later stages of the SDLC.7 JAD is a structured process in which 10–20 users meet under the direction of a facilitator skilled in JAD techniques. The facilitator is a person who sets the meeting agenda and guides the discussion but does not join in the discussion as a participant. He or she does not provide ideas or opinions on the topics under discussion and remains neutral during the session. The facilitator must be an expert in both group process techniques and systems analysis and design techniques. Ideally, the facilitator will have experience with the business under discussion. In many cases, the JAD facilitator is an outside consultant. Organizations may not have a regular day-to-day need for JAD or e-JAD expertise and developing and maintaining this expertise in-house can be expensive. One or two scribes assist the facilitator by recording notes, making copies, and so on. Often, the scribes will use computers and CASE tools to record information as the JAD session proceeds. The JAD group meets for several hours, several days, or several weeks until all the issues have been discussed and the needed information is collected. Most JAD sessions take place in a specially prepared meeting room, away from the participants’ offices, so that they are not interrupted. The meeting room is usually arranged in a U shape so that all participants can easily see each other (Figure 3-9). At the front of the room (the open part of the “U”), there is a whiteboard, flip chart, and/or projector for use by the facilitator, who leads the discussion. One problem with JAD is that it suffers from the traditional problems associated with groups: sometimes people are reluctant to challenge the opinions of others (particularly their boss), a few people often dominate the discussion, and not everyone participates. In a 15-member group, for example, if everyone participates equally, then each person can talk for only 4 minutes each hour and must listen for the remaining 56 minutes—not a very efficient way to collect information. Electronic JAD, or e-JAD, attempts to overcome these problems by the use of groupware. In an e-JAD meeting room, each participant uses special software on a networked computer to anonymously submit ideas, view all ideas generated by the group, and rate and rank ideas through voting. The facilitator uses the electronic tools of the e-JAD system to guide the group process, for maintaining anonymity and enabling the group to focus on each idea’s merits and not the power or rank of the person who contributed the idea. In this way, all participants can contribute at the same time, without fear of reprisal from people with differing opinions. Initial research suggests that e-JAD can reduce the time required to run JAD sessions by 50–80%.8 6More information on JAD can be found in J. Wood and D. Silver, Joint Application Development, New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1989; and Alan Cline, “Joint Application Development for Requirements Collection and Management,” http://www. carolla.com/wp-jad.htm. 7See Kevin Strehlo, “Catching up with the Jones and ‘Requirement’ Creep,” InfoWorld, July 29, 1996; and Kevin Strehlo, “The Makings of a Happy Customer: Specifying Project X,” Infoworld, November 11, 1996. 8For more information on e-JAD, see A.

Interviewing is not as simple as it first appears. Select two people from class to go to the front of the room to demonstrate an interview. (This also can be done in groups.) Have one person be the interviewer, and the other the interviewee. The interviewer should conduct a 5-minute interview regarding the school course registration system. Gather information about the existing system and how the system can be improved. If there is time, repeat with another pair. Questions 1. Describe the body language of the interview pair. 2. What kind of interview was conducted? 3. What kinds of questions were asked? 4. What was done well? How could the interview be improved? YOUR TURN 3-2 Interview Practice 90 Requirements Determination Selecting Participants Selecting JAD participants is done in the same basic way as selecting interview participants. Participants are selected on the basis of information they can contribute, to provide a broad mix of organizational levels, and to build political support for the new system. The need for all JAD participants to be away from their offices at the same time can be a major problem. The office may need to be closed or run with a skeleton staff until the JAD sessions are complete. Ideally, the participants who are released from regular duties to attend the JAD sessions should be the very best people in that business unit. However, without strong management support, JAD sessions can fail, because those selected to attend the JAD session are people who are less likely to be missed (i.e., the least competent people). Designing the JAD Session JAD sessions can run from as little as a half day to several weeks, depending upon the size and scope of the project. In our experience, most JAD sessions tend to last 5–10 days spread over a 3-week period. Most e-JAD sessions tend to last 1–4 days in a 1-week period. As with interviewing, JAD success depends upon a careful plan. JAD sessions usually are designed and structured along the same principles as interviews. Most JAD sessions are designed to collect specific information from users, and this requires the development of a set of questions before the meeting. A difference between JAD and interviewing is that all JAD sessions are structured—they must be carefully planned. In general, closed-ended questions are seldom used, because they do not spark the open and frank discussion that is typical of JAD. In our experience, it is better to proceed top-down in JAD sessions when gathering information. Typically, 30 minutes is allocated to each separate agenda item, and frequent breaks are scheduled throughout the day because participants tire easily. Preparing for the JAD Session As with interviewing, it is important to prepare the analysts and participants for the JAD session. Because the sessions can go beyond the depth of a typical interview and usually are conducted off-site, participants can be more concerned about how to prepare. It is important that the participants understand what is expected of them. If the goal of the JAD session, for example, is to develop an understanding of the current system, then participants can bring procedure manuals and documents with them. If the goal is to identify improvements for a system, then they can think about how they would improve the system prior to the JAD session. Conducting the JAD Session Most JAD sessions try to follow a formal agenda, and most have formal ground rules that define appropriate behavior. Common ground rules include following the schedule, respecting others’ opinions, accepting disagreement, and ensuring that only one person talks at a time. The role of the JAD facilitator can be challenging. Many participants come to the JAD session with strong feelings about the system being discussed. Channeling these feelings so that the session moves forward in a positive direction and getting participants to recognize and accept— but not necessarily agree on—opinions and situations different from their own requires significant expertise in systems analysis and design, JAD, and interpersonal skills. Few systems analysts attempt to facilitate JAD sessions without being trained in JAD techniques, and most apprentice with a skilled JAD facilitator before they attempt to lead their first session. The JAD facilitator performs three key functions. First, he or she ensures that the group sticks to the agenda. The only reason to digress from the agenda is when it becomes clear to the facilitator, project leader, and project sponsor that the JAD session has produced some new for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Requirements Elicitation Techniques 91 information that is unexpected and requires the JAD session (and perhaps the project) to move in a new direction. When participants attempt to divert the discussion away from the agenda, the facilitator must be firm, but polite, in leading the discussion back to the agenda and getting the group back on track. Second, the facilitator must help the group understand the technical terms and jargon that surround the system development process and help the participants understand the specific analysis techniques used. Participants are experts in their business area, but they probably are not experts in systems analysis. The facilitator must therefore minimize the learning required and teach participants how to effectively provide the right information. Third, the facilitator records the group’s input on a public display area, which can be a whiteboard, flip chart, or computer display. He or she structures the information that the group provides and helps the group recognize key issues and important solutions. Under no circumstance should the facilitator insert his or her opinions into the discussion. The facilitator must always remain neutral and simply help the group through the process. The moment the facilitator offers an opinion on an issue, the group will no longer see him or her as a neutral party, but rather as someone who could be attempting to sway the group into some predetermined solution. However, this does not mean that the facilitator should not try to help the group resolve issues. For example, if two items appear to be the same to the facilitator, the facilitator should not say, “I think these may be similar.” Instead, the facilitator should ask, “Are these similar?” If the group decides that they are, the facilitator can combine them and move on. However, if the group decides that they are not similar (despite what the facilitator believes), the facilitator should accept the decision and move on. The group is always right, and the facilitator has no opinion. It is common for the JAD participants to make use of several tools during the JAD session to fully define the new system. Use cases may be created to describe how the users will interact with the new system. Prototypes are commonly created to understand the user interface or navigation through the system more fully. Process models can be constructed to understand the software that will be developed, while a data model can be used to describe the data that will be captured and maintained. The facilitator and the analysts on the project team should use every tool at their disposal to help the participants clarify and define their needs for the new system. Post-JAD Follow-Up As with interviews, a JAD post-session report is prepared and circulated among session attendees. The post-session report is essentially the same as the interview report in Figure 3-8. Since the JAD sessions are longer and provide more information, it usually takes a week or two after the JAD session before the report is complete. Organize yourselves into groups of four to seven people and pick one person in each group to be the JAD facilitator. Using a blackboard, whiteboard, or flip chart, gather information about how the group performs some process (e.g., working on a class assignment, making a sandwich, paying bills, getting to class). How did the JAD session go? Based on your experience, what are some pros and cons of using JAD in a real organization? YOUR TURN 3-3 JAD Practice 92 Requirements Determination Questionnaires A questionnaire is a set of written questions for obtaining information from individuals. Questionnaires often are used when there are many people from whom information and opinions are needed. In our experience, questionnaires are commonly used for systems intended for use outside of the organization (e.g., by customers or vendors) or for systems with business users spread across many geographic locations. Today, most questionnaires are being distributed in electronic form, either via e-mail or on the Web. Selecting Participants As with interviews and JAD sessions, the first step is to select the individuals to whom the questionnaire will be sent. Typically, a sample, or subset, of people are selected who are representative of the entire group. Sampling guidelines are discussed in most statistics books, and most business schools include courses that cover the topic, so we will not discuss it here. The important point in selecting a sample, however, is to realize that not everyone who receives a questionnaire will complete it. On average, only 30–50% of paper and e-mail questionnaires are returned. Response rates for Web-based questionnaires tend to be significantly lower (often, only 5–30%). Designing the Questionnaire Developing good questions is critical for questionnaires because the information on a questionnaire cannot be immediately clarified for a confused respondent. Questions on questionnaires must be very clearly written and must leave little room for misunderstanding; therefore, closedended questions tend to be most common. Questions must enable the analyst to clearly separate facts from opinions. Opinion questions often ask the respondent the extent to which they agree or disagree (e.g., “Are network problems common?”), while factual questions seek more precise values (e.g., “How often does a network problem occur: once an hour, once a day, or once a week?”). See Figure 3-10 for guidelines on questionnaire design. Perhaps the most obvious issue—but one that is sometimes overlooked—is to have a clear understanding of how the information collected from the questionnaire will be analyzed and used. You must address this issue before you distribute the questionnaire because it is too late afterward. Questions should be relatively consistent in style so that the respondent does not have to read instructions for each question before answering it. It is generally a good practice to organize related questions together to make them simpler to answer. Some experts suggest that questionnaires should start with questions important to respondents, so that the questionnaire immediately grabs their interest and induces them to answer it. Perhaps the most important step is to have several colleagues review the questionnaire and then pretest it with a few people drawn from the groups to whom it will be sent. It is surprising how often seemingly simple questions can be misunderstood. • Begin with nonthreatening and interesting questions. • Group items into logically coherent sections. • Do not put important items at the very end of the questionnaire. • Do not crowd a page with too many items. • Avoid abbreviations. • Avoid biased or suggestive items or terms. • Number questions to avoid confusion. • Pretest the questionnaire to identify confusing questions. • Provide anonymity to respondents. FIGURE 3-10 Good questionnaire design. for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Requirements Elicitation Techniques 93 Administering the Questionnaire The key issue in administering the questionnaire is getting participants to complete the questionnaire and send it back. Dozens of marketing research books have been written about ways to improve response rates. Commonly used techniques include clearly explaining why the questionnaire is being conducted and why the respondent has been selected; stating a date by which the questionnaire is to be returned; offering an inducement to complete the questionnaire (e.g., a free pen); and offering to supply a summary of the questionnaire responses. Systems analysts have I have run more than a hundred JAD sessions and have learned several standard “facilitator tricks.” Here are some common problems and some ways to deal with them. • Reducing domination. The facilitator should ensure that no one person dominates the group discussion. The only way to deal with someone who dominates is head on. During a break, approach the person, thank him or her for their insightful comments, and ask them to help you make sure that others also participate. • Encouraging noncontributors. Drawing out people who have participated very little is challenging because you want to bring them into the conversation so that they will contribute again. The best approach is to ask a direct factual question that you are certain they can answer. And it helps to ask the question using some repetition to give them time to think. For example, “Pat, I know you’ve worked shipping orders a long time. You’ve probably been in the Shipping Department longer than anyone else. Could you help us understand exactly what happens when an order is received in Shipping?” • Side discussions. Sometimes participants engage in side conversations and fail to pay attention to the group. The easiest solution is simply to walk close to the people and continue to facilitate right in front of them. Few people will continue a side conversation when you are 2 feet from them, and the entire group’s attention is on you and them. • Agenda merry-go-round. The merry-go-round occurs when a group member keeps returning to the same issue every few minutes and will not let go. One solution is to let the person have 5 minutes to ramble on about the issue while you carefully write down every point on a flip chart or computer file. This flip chart or file is then posted conspicuously on the wall. When the person brings up the issue again, you interrupt them, walk to the paper, and ask them what to add. If they mention something already on the list, you quickly interrupt, point out that it is there, and ask what other information to add. Do not let them repeat the same point but write any new information. • Violent agreement. Some of the worst disagreements occur when participants really agree on the issues but do not realize that they agree because they are using different terms. An example is arguing whether a glass is half empty or half full; they agree on the facts but cannot agree on the words. In this case, the facilitator has to translate the terms into different words and find common ground, so the parties recognize that they really agree. • Unresolved conflict. In some cases, participants do not agree and cannot understand how to determine what alternatives are better. You can help by structuring the issue. Ask for criteria by which the group will identify a good alternative (e.g., “Suppose this idea really did improve customer service. How would I recognize the improved customer service?”). Then once you have a list of criteria, ask the group to assess the alternatives using them. • True conflict. Sometimes, despite every attempt, participants just cannot agree on an issue. The solution is to postpone the discussion and move on. Document the issue as an “open issue” and list it prominently on a flip chart. Have the group return to the issue hours later. Often the issue will resolve itself by then and you have not wasted time on it. If the issue cannot be resolved later, move it to the list of issues to be decided by the project sponsor or some other more senior member of management. • Use humor. Humor is one of the most powerful tools a facilitator has and thus must be used judiciously. The best JAD humor is always in context; never tell jokes but take the opportunity to find the humor in the situation.   PRACTICAL TIP 3-2 Managing Problems in JAD Sessions 94 Requirements Determination additional techniques to improve responses rates inside the organization, such as personally handing out the questionnaire and personally contacting those who have not returned them after a week or two, as well as requesting the respondents’ supervisors to administer the questionnaires in a group meeting. Questionnaire Follow-Up It is helpful to process the returned questionnaires and develop a questionnaire report soon after the questionnaire deadline. This ensures that the analysis process proceeds in a timely fashion and that respondents who requested copies of the results receive them promptly. Document Analysis Project teams often use document analysis to understand the as-is system. Under ideal circumstances, the project team that developed the existing system will have produced documentation, which was then updated by all subsequent projects. In this case, the project team can start by reviewing the documentation and examining the system itself. Unfortunately, most systems are not well documented, because project teams fail to document their projects along the way, and when the projects are over, there is no time to go back and document. Therefore, there may not be much technical documentation about the current system available, or it may not contain updated information about recent system changes. However, there are many helpful documents that do exist in the organization: paper reports, memorandums, policy manuals, user training manuals, organization charts, and forms. Problem reports filed by the system users can be another rich source of information about issues with the existing system. But these documents (forms, reports, policy manuals, organization charts) only tell part of the story. They represent the formal system that the organization uses. Quite often, the “real,” or informal system differs from the formal one, and these differences, particularly large ones, give strong indications of what needs to be changed. For example, forms or reports that are never used likely should be eliminated. Likewise, boxes or questions on forms that are never filled in (or are used for other purposes) should be rethought. See Figure 3-11 for an example of how a document can be interpreted. The most powerful indication that the system needs to be changed is when users create their own forms or add additional information to existing ones. Such changes clearly demonstrate the need for improvements to existing systems. Thus, it is useful to review both blank and completed Organize yourselves into small groups. Have each person develop a short questionnaire to collect information about the frequency in which group members perform some process (e.g., working on a class assignment, making a sandwich, paying bills, getting to class), how long it takes them, how they feel about the process, and opportunities for improving the process. Once everyone has completed his or her questionnaire, ask each member to pass it to the right and then complete his or her neighbor’s questionnaire. Pass the questionnaire back to the creator when it is completed. Questions 1. How did the questionnaire you completed differ from the one you created? 2. What are the strengths of each questionnaire? 3. How would you analyze the survey results if you had received 50 responses? 4. What would you change about the questionnaire that you developed?

This should be labeled Owner’s Name to prevent confusion. The customer did not include area code in the phone number. This should be made more clear. The form does not allow for this fact.

At my neighborhood Publix grocery store, the cashiers always handwrite the total amount of the charge on every credit card charge form, even though it is printed on the form. Why? Because the “back office” staff people who reconcile the cash in the cash drawers with the amount sold at the end of each shift find it hard to read the small print on the credit card forms. Writing in large print makes it easier for them to add the values up. However, cashiers sometimes make mistakes and write the wrong amount on the forms, which causes problems.   Questions 1.

Likewise, when users must access multiple reports to satisfy their information needs, it is a clear sign that new information or new information formats are needed. Observation Observation, the act of watching processes being performed, is a powerful tool to gain insight into the as-is system. Observation enables the analyst to see the reality of a situation, rather than listening to others describe it in interviews or JAD sessions. Several research studies have shown that many managers really do not remember how they work and how they allocate their time. (Quick, how many hours did you spend last week on each of your courses?) Observation is a good way to check the validity of information gathered from other sources such as interviews and questionnaires. In many ways, the analyst becomes an anthropologist as he or she walks through the organization and observes the business system as it functions. The goal is to keep a low profile, to not interrupt those working, and to not influence those being observed. Nonetheless, it is important to understand that what analysts observe may not be the normal day-to-day routine because people tend to be extremely careful in their behavior when they are being watched.9 Even though normal practice may be to break formal organizational rules, the observer is unlikely to see this. (Remember how carefully you drove the last time a police car was behind you?) Thus, what you see may not be what you really want. Observation is often used to supplement interview information. The location of a person’s office and its furnishings gives clues as to their power and influence in the organization, and such clues can be used to support or refute information given in an interview. For example, an analyst might become skeptical of someone who claims to use the existing computer system extensively if the computer is never turned on while the analyst visits. In most cases, observation will support the information that users provide in interviews. When it does not, it is an important signal that extra care must be taken in analyzing the business system. Selecting the Appropriate Techniques Each of the requirements elicitation techniques just discussed has strengths and weaknesses. No one technique is always better than the others, and in practice, most projects benefit from a combination of techniques. Thus, it is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each technique and when to use each (Figure 3-12). One issue not discussed is that of the analysts’ experience. In general, document analysis and observation require the least amount of training, while JAD sessions are the most challenging. Visit the library at your college or university and observe how the book check-out process occurs. First, watch several students checking books out, and then check one out yourself. Prepare a brief summary report of your observations. When you return to class, share your observations with others. You may notice that not all the reports present the same information. Why? How would the information be different had you used the interview or JAD technique?

Some techniques are more suited for use at different stages of the analysis process, whether understanding the as-is system, identifying improvements, or developing the to-be system. Interviews and JAD are commonly used in all three stages. In contrast, document analysis and observation usually are most helpful for understanding the as-is system, although they occasionally provide information about improvements. Questionnaires are often used to gather information about the as-is system, as well as general information about improvements. Depth of Information The depth of information refers to how rich and detailed the information is that the technique usually produces and the extent to which the technique is useful at obtaining not only facts and opinions, but also an understanding of why those facts and opinions exist. Interviews and JAD sessions are especially useful at providing a good depth of rich and detailed information and helping the analyst to understand the reasons behind them. At the other extreme, document analysis and observation are useful for obtaining facts, but little beyond that. Questionnaires can provide a medium depth of information, soliciting both facts and opinions with little understanding of why. Breadth of Information Breadth of information refers to the range of information and information sources that can be easily collected by that technique. Questionnaires and document analysis both are easily capable of soliciting a wide range of information from many information sources. In contrast, interviews and observation require the analyst to visit each information source individually and, therefore, take more time. JAD sessions are in the middle because many information sources are brought together at the same time. Integration of Information One of the most challenging aspects of requirements gathering is the integration of information from different sources. Simply put, different people can provide conflicting information. Combining this information and attempting to resolve differences in opinions or facts is usually very time consuming because it means contacting each information source in turn, explaining the discrepancy, and attempting to refine the information. In many cases, the individual wrongly perceives that the analyst is challenging his or her information, when in fact the source of conflict is another user in the organization. This can make the user defensive and make it hard to resolve the differences.

If two users provide conflicting information, the conflict becomes immediately obvious, as does the source of the conflict. The immediate integration of information is the single-most important benefit of JAD that distinguishes it from other techniques, and therefore many organizations use JAD for important projects. User Involvement User involvement refers to the amount of time and energy the intended users of the new system must devote to the analysis process. It is generally agreed that, as users become more involved in the analysis process, the chance of success increases. However, user involvement can have a significant cost, and not all users are willing to contribute valuable time and energy. Questionnaires, document analysis, and observation place the least burden on users, while JAD sessions require the greatest effort. Cost Cost is always an important consideration. In general, questionnaires, document analysis, and observation are low-cost techniques (although observation can be quite time consuming). The low cost does not imply that they are more or less effective than the other techniques. We regard interviews and JAD sessions as having moderate costs. In general, JAD sessions are much more expensive initially, because they require many users to be absent from their offices for significant periods, and they often involve highly paid consultants. However, JAD sessions significantly reduce the time spent in information integration and thus cost less in the long term. Requirements Analysis Strategies The previous section discussed five essential techniques that analysts will use to interact with stakeholders in the system development project to elicit and define requirements. As we discussed earlier in the chapter, the analyst often must encourage the stakeholders to think critically about the needs for the new system and discover the true underlying requirements. In this section, we present several strategies that the analyst can employ with the stakeholders to accomplish this goal. Problem Analysis The most straightforward (and probably the most common) requirements analysis strategy is problem analysis. Problem analysis means asking the users and managers to identify problems with the as-is system and to describe how to solve them in the to-be system. Most users have a good idea of the changes they would like to see, and most will be quite vocal about suggesting them. Most changes tend to solve problems rather than capitalize on opportunities, but that is possible, too. Improvements from problem analysis tend to be small and incremental (e.g., add a field to store the customer’s cell phone number; provide a new report that currently does not exist). This type of improvement often effectively improves a system’s efficiency or ease of use. However, it often provides only minor improvements in business value—the new system is better than the old, but it may be hard to identify significant monetary benefits from the new system. Root Cause Analysis The ideas produced by problem analysis tend to be solutions to problems. All solutions make assumptions about the nature of the problem, assumptions that may or may not be valid. In our for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Requirements Analysis Strategies 99 experience, users (and most people in general) tend to jump quickly to solutions without fully considering the nature of the problem. Sometimes the solutions are appropriate, but many times they address a symptom of the problem, not the true problem or root cause itself.10 For example, suppose that the users report that “inventory stock-outs happen frequently.” Inventory stock-outs are not good, of course, and one obvious way to reduce their occurrence is to increase the quantity of items kept in stock. This action incurs costs, however, so it is worthwhile to investigate the underlying cause of the frequent stock-outs instead of jumping to a quick-fix solution. The solutions that users propose (or systems that analysts consider) may address either symptoms or causes, but without careful analysis, it is difficult to tell which one. Finding out later that you have just spent millions of dollars and have not fixed the true underlying problem is a horrible feeling! Root cause analysis focuses on problems first rather than solutions. The analyst starts by having the users generate a list of problems with the current system, then prioritizes the problems in order of importance. Starting with the most important, the users and/or analysts generate all possible root causes for the problem. As shown in Figure  3-13, the problem of “too frequent stock-outs” has several potential root causes (inaccurate on-hand counts; incorrect reorder points; lag in placing supplier orders). Each possible root cause is investigated, and additional Supplier order lag Inaccurate on-hand counts Lag in supplier order approval Lag in recording sold inventory Reorder point too low Lag in identifying best supplier Infrequent manual count reconciliation Economic order quantity (EOQ) too low Lag in sending order to supplier Lag in recording items received from suppliers Incorrect reorder quantities Frequent inventory stock-outs FIGURE 3-13 Root cause analysis for inventory stock outs. 10Two good books that discuss the problems in finding the root causes to problems are E. M. Goldratt and J. Cox, The Goal, Croton-on-Hudson, NY: North River Press, 1986; and E. M. Goldratt, The Haystack Syndrome, Croton-on-Hudson, NY: North River Press, 1990. 100 Requirements Determination root causes are identified. As Figure 3-13 shows, it is sometimes useful to display the potential root causes in a tree-like hierarchy. Ultimately, the investigation process reveals the true root cause or causes of the problem, enabling the team to design the system to correct the problem with the right solution. The key point in root cause analysis is to always challenge the obvious and dig into the problem deeply enough that the true underlying cause(s) is revealed. Duration Analysis Duration analysis requires a detailed examination of the amount of time it takes to perform each process in the current as-is system. The analysts begin by determining the total amount of time it takes, on average, to perform a set of business processes for a typical input. They then time each of the individual steps (or subprocesses) in the business process. The time to complete the basic steps are then totaled and compared with the total for the overall process. A significant difference between the two—and, in our experiences, the total time often can be 10 or even 100 times longer than the sum of the parts—indicates that this part of the process is badly in need of a major overhaul. For example, suppose that the analysts are working on a home mortgage system and discover that, on average, it takes 30 days for the bank to approve a mortgage. They then look at each of the basic steps in the process (e.g., data entry, credit check, title search, appraisal, etc.) and find that the total amount of time actually spent on each mortgage is about 8 hours. This is a strong indication that the overall process is badly broken because it takes 30 days to perform 1 day’s work. These problems likely occur because the process is badly fragmented. Many different people must perform different activities before the process is complete. In the mortgage example, the application probably sits on many peoples’ desks for long periods of time before it is processed. Processes in which many different people work on small parts of the inputs are prime candidates for process integration or parallelization. Process integration means changing the fundamental process so that fewer people work on the input, which often requires changing the processes and retraining staff to perform a wider range of duties. Process parallelization means changing the process so that all the individual steps are performed at the same time. In the mortgage application example, there is probably no reason that the credit check cannot be performed at the same time as the appraisal and title check. Activity-Based Costing Activity-based costing is a similar analysis that examines the cost of each major process or step in a business process rather than the time taken.11 The analysts identify the costs associated with each of the basic functional steps or processes, identify the costliest processes, and focus their improvement efforts on them. Assigning costs is conceptually simple. You just examine the direct cost of labor and materials for each input. Materials costs are easily assigned in a manufacturing process, while labor costs are usually calculated based on the amount of time spent on the input and the hourly cost of the staff. However, as you may recall from a managerial accounting course, there are indirect costs such as rent, depreciation, and so on that also can be included in activity costs. Informal Benchmarking Benchmarking refers to studying how other organizations perform a business process to learn how your organization can do something better. Benchmarking helps the organization by introducing ideas that employees may never have considered, but that have the potential to add value. 11Many books have been written on activity-based costing. Useful ones include K. B. Burk and D. W. Webster, Activity-Based Costing, Fairfax, VA: American Management Systems, 1994; and D. T. Hicks, Activity-Based Costing: Making It Work for Small and Mid-Sized Companies, New York: John Wiley, 1998. The two books by Eli Goldratt mentioned previously (The Goal and The Haystack Syndrome) also offer unique insights into costing. for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Requirements Analysis Strategies 101 Informal benchmarking is common for “customer-facing” business processes (i.e., those processes that interact with the customer). With informal benchmarking, the managers and analysts think about other organizations, or visit them as customers to watch how the business process is performed. In many cases, the business studied may be a known leader in the industry or simply a related firm. For example, suppose that the team is developing a website for a car dealer. The project sponsor, key managers, and key team members would likely visit the website of competitors, those of others in the car industry (e.g., manufacturers, accessories suppliers), and those of other industries that have won awards for their websites. Outcome Analysis Outcome analysis focuses on understanding the fundamental outcomes that provide value to customers. While these outcomes sound as though they should be obvious, they often are not. For example, suppose that you are an insurance company and one of your customers has just had a car accident. What is the fundamental outcome from the customer’s perspective? Traditionally, insurance companies have answered this question by assuming that the customer wants to receive the insurance payment quickly. To the customer, however, the payment is only a means to the real outcome: a repaired car. The insurance company might benefit by extending its view of the business process past its traditional boundaries to include, not simply paying for repairs, but performing the repairs or contracting with an authorized body shop to do them. With this approach, the system analysts encourage the managers and project sponsor to pretend that they are customers and to think carefully about what the organization’s products and services enable the customers to do—and what they could enable the customer to do. Technology Analysis Many major changes in business over the past decade have been enabled by new technologies. Technology analysis therefore starts by having the analysts and managers develop a list of important and interesting technologies. Then the group systematically identifies how each technology could be applied to the business process and identifies how the business would benefit. For example, one useful technology might be the Internet. A manufacturer could develop an extranet application for its suppliers. Rather than ordering parts for its products, the manufacturer makes its production schedule available electronically to its suppliers, who ship the needed parts so that they arrive at the plant just in time. This saves significant costs because it eliminates the need for people to monitor the production schedule and issue purchase orders. A group of executives from a Fortune 500 company used duration analysis to discuss their procurement process. Using a huge wall of Velcro and a handful of placards, a facilitator proceeded to map out the company’s process for procuring a $50 software upgrade. Having quantified the time, it took to complete each step, she then assigned costs based on the salaries of the employees involved. The 15-minute exercise left the group stunned. Their procurement process had gotten so convoluted that it took 18 days, countless hours of paperwork, and nearly $22,000 in people time to get the product ordered, received, and up and running on the requester’s desktop. Adapted from: “For Good Measure,” CIO Magazine, March 1, 1999, by Debby Young. Concepts in Action 3-E A Process in Need of Improvement 102 Requirements Determination Activity Elimination Activity elimination is exactly what it sounds like. The analysts and managers work together to identify how the organization could eliminate each and every activity in the business process, how the function could operate without it, and what effects are likely to occur. Initially, managers are reluctant to conclude that processes can be eliminated, but this is a “force-fit” exercise in that they must eliminate each activity. In some cases, the results are silly; nonetheless, participants must address each and every activity in the business process. For example, in the home mortgage approval process discussed earlier, the managers and analysts would start by eliminating the first activity, entering the data into the mortgage company’s computer. This leads to one of two obvious possibilities: (1) Eliminate the use of a computer system or (2) make someone else do the data entry (e.g., the customer, over the Web). They would then eliminate the next activity, the credit check. Silly, right? After all, making sure the applicant has good credit is critical in issuing a loan, isn’t it? Not really. The real answer depends upon how many times the credit check identifies bad applications. If all or almost all applicants have good IBM Credit was a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM responsible for financing mainframe computers sold by IBM. While some customers bought mainframes outright or obtained financing from other sources, financing computers provided significant additional profit. When an IBM sales representative made a sale, he or she would immediately call IBM Credit to obtain a financing quote. The call was received by a credit officer who would record the information on a request form. The form would then be sent to the credit department to check the customer’s credit status. This information would be recorded on the form, which was then sent to the business practices department, which would write a contract (sometimes reflecting changes requested by the customer). The form and the contract would then go to the pricing department, which used the credit information to establish an interest rate and record it on the form. The form and contract were then sent to the clerical group, where an administrator would prepare a cover letter quoting the interest rate and send the letter and contract via Federal Express to the customer. The problem at IBM Credit was a major one. Getting a financing quote took anywhere from 4 to 8 days (6 days, on average), giving the customer time to rethink the order or find financing elsewhere. While the quote was being prepared, sales representatives would often call to find out where the quote was in the process, so that they could tell the customer when to expect it. However, no one at IBM Credit could answer the question, because the paper forms could be in any department and it was impossible to locate one without physically walking through the departments and going through the piles of forms on everyone’s desk. IBM Credit examined the process and changed it so that each credit request was logged into a computer system so that each department could record an application’s status as soon as it was completed and sent it to the next department. In this way, sales representatives could call the credit office and quickly learn the status of each application. IBM used some sophisticated management science queuing theory analysis to balance workloads and staff across the different departments so that no applications would be overloaded. They also introduced performance standards for each department (e.g., the pricing decision had to be completed within 1 day after that department received an application). However, process times got worse, even though each department was achieving almost 100% compliance on its performance goals. After some investigation, managers found that when people got busy, they conveniently found errors that forced them to return the credit request to the previous department for correction, thereby removing it from their time measurements.

Eliminating it may result in lower costs, even with the cost of bad loans, unless the number of applicants with poor credit greatly increases. Comparing Analysis Strategies Each of the requirements analysis strategies discussed here has its own purpose. No one technique is inherently better than the others. Remember that an organization will likely have a wide range of projects in its portfolio; the requirements analysis strategy should be chosen to fit the nature of the project. Problem analysis and root cause analysis tend to be most useful in situations with a narrow focus where efficiency gains are sought. Duration analysis and activity-based costing strategies help the team find the most “broken” business processes so that those processes can be redesigned and improved. Outcome analysis, technology analysis, and informal benchmarking help the team think “outside the box” and are very useful when the team is trying to create completely new ways of accomplishing the business processes. Applying the Concepts at DrōnTeq Once the DrōnTeq IS project approval committee approved the system request and feasibility analysis and the project was planned, the project team began performing analysis activities. These included gathering requirements by a variety of techniques and analyzing the requirements that were gathered. Some highlights of the project team’s activities are presented next. Eliciting and Analyzing Requirements Since there is no existing Client Services system in place, Jiang did not spend much time on understanding the current system and processes. He did believe, however, that it would be important to understand the existing Web-based drone sales processes and systems already used by the Sales department to ensure consistency between the two systems. Two requirements-gathering techniques improved the understanding of the current systems and processes—document analysis and interviews. First, the project team collected existing reports (e.g., sales forms, screen shots of the online sales screens) and system documentation (requirements definition (Figure 3-3), data model, process models) that explained the as-is Sales system. They were able to gather a good amount of information about the existing order processes and systems in this way. When questions arose, they conducted short interviews with the person who provided the documentation, for clarification. Next, Jiang interviewed the senior analysts for the current Sales system to get a better understanding of how those systems worked. He asked whether they had any ideas for the new system, particularly some of the trickier aspects that he anticipated. Jiang also interviewed a contact from the ISP and the IT person who supported DrōnTeq’s current website—both provided information about the existing communications infrastructure at DrōnTeq and its Web capabilities. Carmella suggested that the project team conduct several JAD sessions with Eric Chen and Peter Lyons (top DrōnTeq executives), Carmella Herrera, and several other senior managers in the new business unit, members of the IT staff, plus several drone pilots and potential clients who may use the new system. Together, the group would brainstorm and clarify the features desired in the Client Services system. 104 Requirements Determination Jiang facilitated three JAD sessions that were conducted over the course of a week. Jiang’s past facilitation experience helped the eight-person meetings run smoothly and stay on track. Because this project introduces new business processes, Jiang used the techniques of informal benchmarking, outcome analysis, and technology analysis in his JAD design. The JAD sessions generated ideas about how DrōnTeq could apply technology to provide value to the primary users of the Client Services system. Jiang had the group categorize the ideas into three sets: “definite” ideas that would have a good probability of providing business value, “possible” ideas that might add business value, and “unlikely” ideas. Because of the importance of the user interface to the future users of the new system (clients and pilots), several prototypes were created during the JAD session. These prototypes helped clarify the desired interactions between the users and the system. Requirements Definition Throughout these activities, the project team collected information and compiled requirements for the system from the information. As the project progressed, requirements were added to the requirements definition and grouped by requirements type. When questions arose, the team worked with Carmella and Jiang to confirm that requirements were in scope. The requirements that fell outside of the scope of the current system were stored in a separate document that would be saved for future use. At the end of the analysis phase, the requirements definition was distributed to Eric, Peter, Carmella, two Client Services managers who would work with the system on the business side, and several pilot and customer system users. This group then met for a 2-day JAD session to clarify, finalize, and prioritize the requirements and to create use cases (Chapter 4) to show how the system would be used. During this session, additional prototyping took place so that the team could evaluate several different approaches to the way in which prospective drone assignments could be communicated to the pilots and pilots could “bid” on the assignments they wanted. In this way, the group clarified how to use their technology options to provide the best experience for the future users of the system. After the JAD session, the project team also spent time creating a process model (Chapter 4) and a data model (Chapter 5) to depict the processes and data in the future system. Client Services managers and the IS department reviewed the documents during interviews with the project team. Figure 3-14 shows a portion of the final requirements definition. System Proposal Jiang reviewed the requirements definition and the other deliverables that the project team created during the analysis phase. He reviewed the work plan and made some slight changes. He also conferred with Carmella and her Client Services managers to review the feasibility analysis. He felt strongly that the analysis phase work had reduced much of the uncertainty about several technical and organizational feasibility factors. All deliverables from the project were then combined into a system proposal and submitted to the IS project approval committee. Figure 3-15 shows the outline of the DrōnTeq system proposal. Carmella and Jiang met with the approval committee and presented the highlights of what was learned during the analysis phase and the final concept of the new system. Based on the proposal and presentation, the approval committee decided that it would continue to fund the Client Services system. for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Applying the Concepts at DrōnTeq 105 Functional Requirements (Clients): 1.

The purpose of the organization is to provide some financial support to the families of deceased member firefighters and to organize a conference each year bringing together firefighters from all over the state. Annually, members are billed dues and calls. “Calls” are additional funds required to take care of payments made to the families of deceased members. The bookkeeping work for the association is handled by the elected treasurer, Bob Smith, although it is widely known that his wife, Laura, does all the work. Bob runs unopposed each year at the election since no one wants to take over the tedious and time-consuming job of tracking memberships. Bob is paid a stipend of $12,000 per year, but his wife spends well over 20 hours per week on the job. The organization, however, is not happy with their performance. A  computer system is used to track the billing and receipt of funds. This system was developed in 1994 by a computer science student and his father. The system is simple system developed in Access. The most immediate problem facing the treasurer and his wife is the fact that there is no for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Minicases 109 one around who knows how to maintain the system. One query in particular takes 7 hours to run. Over the years, they have just avoided running this query, although the information in it would be quite useful. Questions from members concerning their statements cannot easily be answered. Usually, Bob or Laura just jots down the inquiry and returns a call with the answer. Sometimes, it takes 3–5 hours to find the information needed to answer the question. Often, they must perform calculations manually since the system was not developed to handle certain types of queries. When member information is entered into the system, the input form is poorly organized. This makes data entry slow and error-prone. Sometimes a new member is entered but disappears from the records. The report of membership used in the conference materials does not alphabetize members by city. Only cities are listed in the correct order. A. What requirements analysis technique or techniques would you recommend for this situation? Explain your answer. B. Prepare an Interview Plan for your first interview with Laura Smith in which you want to discover as many of the problems in this system as you can and find out Laura’s opinions on the priority of correcting these problems. Note: If using the flipped classroom model, students should study the requirements analysis strategy and interview preparation material before class. Divide the class into small groups. Each group should determine their choice of the best requirements analysis technique. Then, have the groups prepare an Interview Plan for Laura’s interview. Have each group present their Interview Plan and discuss as a class the strengths and weaknesses of each plan. 2. Brian Callahan, IS project manager, is just about ready to depart for an urgent meeting called by Joe Campbell, manager of manufacturing operations. A major BPI project, sponsored by Joe, recently cleared the approval hurdle, and Brian helped bring the project through project initiation. Now that the approval committee has given the go-ahead, Brian has been working on the project’s analysis plan. One evening, while playing golf with a friend who works in the manufacturing operations department, Brian learned that Joe wants to shorten the project’s time frame from Brian’s original estimate of 13 months. Brian’s friend overheard Joe say, “I can’t see why that IS project team needs to spend all that time ‘analyzing’ things. They’ve got two weeks scheduled just to look at the existing system! That seems like a real waste. I want that team to get going on building my system.” Because Brian has a little inside knowledge about Joe’s agenda for this meeting, he has been considering how to handle Joe. What do you suggest that Brian tell Joe? 3. Barry has recently been assigned to a project team that will be developing a new retail store management system for a chain of submarine sandwich shops. Barry has several years of experience in programming but has not done much analysis in his career. He was a little nervous about the new work he would be doing but was confident that he could handle any assignment he was given. One of Barry’s first assignments was to visit one of the submarine sandwich shops and prepare an observation report on how the store operates. Barry planned to arrive at the store around noon, but he chose a store in an area of town he was unfamiliar with, and due to traffic delays and difficulty in finding the store, he did not arrive until 1:30 PM. The store manager was not expecting him and refused to let a stranger behind the counter until Barry had him contact the project sponsor (the director of store management) back at company headquarters to verify who he was and what his purpose was. After finally securing permission to observe, Barry stationed himself prominently in the work area behind the counter so that he could see everything. The staff had to maneuver around him as they went about their tasks; however, there were only occasional minor collisions. Barry noticed that the store staff seemed to be going about their work very slowly and deliberately, but he supposed that was because the store was not very busy. At first, Barry questioned each worker about what he or she was doing, but the store manager eventually asked him not to interrupt their work so much—he was interfering with their service to the customers. By 3:30, Barry was a little bored. He decided to leave, figuring that he could get back to the office and prepare his report before 5:00 PM that day. He was sure that his team leader would be pleased with his quick completion of his assignment. As he drove, he reflected, “There really won’t be much to say in this report. All they do is take the order, make the sandwich, collect the payment, and hand over the order. It’s really simple!” Barry’s confidence in his analytical skills soared as he anticipated his team leader’s praise. Back at the store, the store manager shook his head, commenting to his staff, “He comes here at the slowest time of day on the slowest day of the week. He never even looked at all the work I was doing in the back room while he was here—summarizing yesterday’s sales, checking inventory on hand, making up resupply orders for the weekend . . . plus he never even considered our store opening and closing procedures. I hate to think that the new store management system is going to be built by someone like that. I’d better contact Chuck (the director of store management) and let him know what went on here today.” Evaluate Barry’s conduct of the observation assignment. 4. The following set of questions were developed to administer to the customers of a food catering business. Put yourself in the position of a customer who has ordered food from this catering business at least one time in the past. You have just received this survey in an e-mail from the catering company. The e-mail contains a link that takes you to a Web-based survey process (such as Google Forms or SurveyMonkey). 110 Requirements Determination As you read each question, evaluate it carefully. Is it easy to answer? Do understand how to answer? Is there any confusion in your mind about what response is expected? Do you think your answer will be meaningful and useful to the system development team? • What is your company’s name? • On a scale from 1 to 10, how easy do you find the ordering process? 0-------------------------------------------------------------------10 • How long does it take to place a catering request? • In your opinion, what is the biggest problem with the current system of placing a catering order? • How do you feel the process could be simplified? • What features would you like to see in the new system? • Do you value convenience and speed or accuracy and a detailed description when placing an order? • How often do you use our catering services? • On a scale from 1 to 10, how often are you satisfied with the delivered products? 0-------------------------------------------------------------------10 • On a scale from 1 to 10, how likely are you to choose our catering again? 0-------------------------------------------------------------------10 Note: If using the flipped classroom model, students should study the questionnaire design material before class. This question works well as a discussion vehicle for the entire class. Present each question and challenge the class to identify weaknesses and faulty assumptions underlying the question. Then have class members revise the question into a more useful form. 5. Anne has been given the task of conducting a survey of salesclerks who will be using a new order entry system being developed for a household products catalog company. The goal of the survey is to identify the clerks’ opinions on the strengths and weaknesses of the current system. There are about 50 clerks who work in three different cities, so a survey seemed like an ideal way of gathering the needed information from the clerks. Anne developed the questionnaire carefully and pretested it on several sales supervisors who were available at corporate headquarters. After revising it according to their suggestions, she sent a paper version of the questionnaire to each clerk, asking that it be returned within 1 week. After 1 week, she had only three completed questionnaires returned. After another week, Anne received just two more completed questionnaires. Feeling somewhat desperate, Anne then sent out an e-mail version of the questionnaire, again to all the clerks, asking them to respond to the questionnaire by e-mail as soon as possible. She received two e-mail questionnaires and three messages from clerks who had completed the paper version expressing annoyance at being bothered with the same questionnaire a second time. At this point, Anne has just a 14% response rate, which she is sure will not please her team leader. What suggestions do you have that could have improved Anne’s response rate to the questionnaire? 6. Central City Community College recently authorized a system development project focused on the college’s Career Center. A job posting capability is in the existing system, but there is no way for students to upload resumes or schedule interviews with recruiters. The Career Center director wants to add several new features to make the system more useful and valuable to both students and recruiters. The following Business Needs were drawn from the System Request document. Business Needs: Expansion and enhancements are needed to improve the existing system and correct several deficiencies. Most critically: • Students are unable to upload resumes • Recruiters cannot easily search student resumes for candidates • Recruiters cannot post interview schedules for on-campus recruiting • Students are unable to schedule recruiting interviews A.

Use cases and process models are used to help understand and describe the tasks the system must support (functional requirements) and how those tasks will be organized into processes that complete the response to an event. Use cases are used to explain and document the interaction that is required between the user and the system to accomplish the user’s task. Use cases are created to help the development team understand the steps that are involved in accomplishing the user’s goals more fully. Once created, use cases often are the basis for detailed, new system functional requirements. Process models graphically describe business processes—the activities that people do. OBJECTIVES • Explain the purpose of use cases in the analysis phase of the SDLC. • Describe the various parts of a use case and the purpose of each part. • Describe how use cases contribute to the functional requirements. • Describe how use cases inform the development of test plans. • Explain the process used to create a use case. • Explain the rules and style guidelines for data flow diagrams. • Describe the process used to create data flow diagrams. • Create data flow diagrams. 112 Understanding Processes with Use Cases and Process Models Introduction Chapter 3 discussed the overall process of the analysis phase of the SDLC, resulting in the system proposal deliverable. Within the system proposal is the requirements definition, defining exactly what the new system should do. A key aspect of determining the requirements for the new system is understanding the user requirements: the things the users need to accomplish with the new system. In this chapter, we discuss use cases as a means of expressing user requirements. We also discuss how the requirements definition and use cases may be further clarified through a process model. Since one of our goals in the systems development project is to create usable software, it is imperative to know what the users must do with it. Use cases help us understand and clarify the users’ required interactions with the system and can help us more fully understand the functional requirements of the new system. Process models graphically illustrate the processes or activities that are performed and how data move among them. Consequently, use cases and process models are used extensively in the analysis phase when working with the users in interviews and workshop settings as a means of discovering and depicting user and functional requirements. A use case represents how a system interacts with its environment by illustrating the activities that are performed by the users of the system and the system’s responses. The goal is to create a set of use cases that describe all the tasks that users need to perform using the system. Use cases are often thought of as an external or functional view of a business process, showing how the users view the process rather than the internal mechanisms by which the process operates. Since use cases describe the system’s activities from the user’s perspective in words, it is essential to involve users in their development. Therefore, creating use cases helps ensure that users’ insights are explicitly incorporated into the new system. Use cases are especially valuable for business system applications and websites. Both types of systems commonly involve extensive user interactions, so the use case is particularly helpful. Use cases are not as useful in certain other settings, such as batch processes, computationally intensive applications, or data warehousing. These settings have extensive “internal” complexity but limited user interactions. Therefore, the use case is not necessarily the best tool to use in these applications. As always, the analyst needs to be skilled in using an array of tools and must be able to select and apply the appropriate ones for the situation. Once the team has created a set of use cases that describe the things the users need to accomplish with the new system, there will be several important contributions to the analysis phase. First, the use cases will help the analysts develop a more detailed understanding of the new system’s functional requirements. System developers commonly find that a well-constructed set of use cases includes most of the functional requirements. Second, use cases are helpful in understanding exceptions, special cases, and error handling requirements in the new system. These requirements are easy to overlook but creating use cases helps to discover them. Finally, the textbased use case is easy for the users to understand and flows easily into the creation of process models and the data model (Chapter 5), which are used by the analysts to more fully define the software that will be developed in the new system. Process models have been a part of structured systems analysis and design techniques for many years. Today, with use cases gaining favor due to their ability to clarify user requirements in an understandable way, you may see that organizations place less emphasis on process modeling than in the past. We find, however, that graphically depicting the system that will be developed in a set of well-organized diagrams is a particularly useful approach. Remember that our goal is to be able to employ an array of tools and techniques that will help us understand and clarify what the new system must do before the new system is constructed. We focus on one of the most common process modeling techniques: data flow diagramming.1 1  Another commonly used process modeling technique is IDEF0. IDEF0 is used extensively throughout the US Government. For more information about IDEF0, see FIPS 183: Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0), Federal Information Processing Standards Publications, Washington, DC: US Department of Commerce, 1993. for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com What Is a Use Case? 113 In this chapter, we first explain the use case through several examples, describe their basic elements, and show alternative formats. We then illustrate the process of creating use cases with another example and apply the concepts to the DrōnTeq running case. We then explain how to read DFDs and describe their basic syntax. Then we describe the process used to build DFDs that draw information from the use cases and from additional requirements information gathered from the users. We conclude with illustrations of DFDs based on the DrōnTeq running case. What Is a Use Case? A use case depicts a set of activities performed to produce some output result. Each use case describes how an event triggers actions performed by the system and the user. With this type of event-driven modeling, everything in the system can be thought of as a response to some trigger event. When there are no events, the system is at rest, patiently waiting for the next event to trigger it. When a trigger event occurs, the system (and the people using it) responds, performs the actions defined in the use case, and then returns to the waiting state. The Use Case Concept in a Nutshell The easiest way to appreciate the role of a use case is to follow along with this brief example. Imagine you have accompanied a friend to your local post office to purchase postage stamps. When you arrive at the post office, the service window is closed, but there is an automated postage vending kiosk to use. While your friend makes the purchase, you put your observation skills to work (Chapter 3). Your notes on your observation of the user/system interaction are as follows: System: Displays Welcome message and flashes “Start” button User: Presses “Start” button System: Displays list of options (buy stamps, mail package, etc.) User: Presses “Buy Stamps” button System: Displays list of stamp-buying options (type, denomination, quantity) User: Selects desired stamps by pressing button next to choice System: Displays dollar amount of purchase and asks for purchase confirmation User: Presses “Yes” button to confirm purchase System: Asks user to swipe card and flashes light next to card reader User: Swipes debit card in card reader System: Displays keypad for PIN entry and requests PIN User: Types in PIN on keypad System: Confirms payment transaction and asks if user wants a printed receipt User: Presses “Yes” button to request receipt System: Prints receipt and asks user to take receipt User: Takes receipt System: Displays message to wait while it prints the purchased stamps User: Takes stamps when printing is done System: Displays Thank You Message for 10 seconds, then displays Welcome message 114 Understanding Processes with Use Cases and Process Models As you can see from this user–system dialog, the postage purchase transaction is accomplished through a coordinated series of prompts, user entries, and system actions. The user– system dialog tells a lot about what the user does to complete the desired task while working with the system, and that is its primary purpose. We use the description of user and system actions and responses to understand the user’s perspective on the system more fully. Any user who reads through this brief dialog should be able to fully grasp how he/she will accomplish the purchase of stamps with the kiosk. Now let us change the situation slightly. Assume that the vending kiosk has not been developed. As the analysts are defining what this kiosk should do, a functional requirement stating “The kiosk system will provide the option to purchase postage stamps” was included in the requirements definition. This statement clearly specifies a function of the system but provides few details about how the system should support the user’s performance. If a systems analyst works with a user and together they create the user–system dialog just shown, we get a much clearer understanding of how the system can support the user in accomplishing this task. In essence, we have created a use case. Although we do not know much at all about what is going on “behind the scenes” of the system, we can now create a much more complete description of functional requirements: The kiosk system will: • enable the user to begin a transaction • display a list of purchase transaction options that are available on the kiosk • enable the user to specify the type of purchase transaction desired • display a list of options for the purchase type • enable the user to specify the desired type of postage and quantity desired • display the amount due for the purchase • enable the user to confirm the purchase • enable the user to pay for the purchase with credit/debit card • complete the credit/debit card transaction securely • print receipt if requested by user • print stamps purchased This list shows that we are well on the way to clarifying the functional requirements for this system. This brief example displays the role of the use case in a nutshell—to define the expected interaction between user and system and use that interaction to clarify and more fully describe the system’s functional requirements. Use Case Formats and Elements Use cases can vary considerably from one organization to another in terms of the content included, the format followed, and the degree of formality employed. In this section, we show the casual use case format. Casual Use Case Format To illustrate a use case in the casual style, we will employ a use case from the already completed Sales System at DrōnTeq. The Sales System was created several years ago to allow DrōnTeq for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Use Case Formats and Elements 115 customers to place orders for the commercial-grade drones that DrōnTeq manufactures. In this example use case, customers order a base model drone and then may add or modify various features on the drone, such as batteries, motors, cameras, and other sensors. The process of ordering the customized drone involves four main steps: authenticating the customer (because DrōnTeq provides commercial-grade drones and sells to commercial drone operators, it requires its customers to create an account before ordering); creating the preliminary order; getting shop manager approval for the requested optional features; and transmitting the approved order to the drone customization shop. The example use case focuses on the second step of this overall process: create a preliminary custom drone order. Refer to Figure 4-1 as we describe the sections of the use case. There are numerous pieces of information in the use case, each with an important role to play in describing the response to the triggering event. We will describe each section starting at the top. Basic Information Each use case has a name and number. The name should be as simple, yet descriptive, as possible. The number is simply a sequential number that serves to reference each use case (e.g., UC-6). The description briefly conveys the use case’s purpose. The priority may be assigned to indicate the relative significance of the use case in the overall system. Some use cases will describe essential activities that the system must perform and hence will have a high priority level. Other use cases may describe activities that are less critical, having medium or low priority. Classifying the priority level is especially useful with a methodology that implements the system in a series of versions so that the most essential system features can be targeted first. The actor refers a person, another software system, or a hardware device that interacts with the system to achieve a useful goal. Some organizations use the term user role rather than actor Actor: Customer Description: The customer selects and customizes a commercial drone to purchase Trigger: Customer wants to purchase a commercial drone Type: External Temporal Preconditions: 1.

A template for this figure is available on the student website. 116 Understanding Processes with Use Cases and Process Models because there may be several different user groups who interact with the system in the same way. For example, an order entry use case could be performed with either customers or order entry clerks performing the user role. In our example, the actor is the customer wanting to purchase a customized drone from DrōnTeq. Another element of basic information is the trigger for the use case—the event that causes the use case to begin. A trigger can be an external trigger, such as a customer placing an order, the fire alarm ringing, or inventory levels reaching the reorder point. A trigger can also be a temporal trigger, where the event is time-based, such as ebook becoming overdue at the library or it’s time to process the weekly payroll. Preconditions Use cases are often performed in a sequence to accomplish an overall business task. When this practice is followed, it is important to define clearly what needs to be accomplished before each use case begins. These preconditions define the state the system must be in before the use case commences. In our example, you can see that for a customer to place an order, he must be authenticated, and the Sales System Order Processing application is online. These tasks are taken care of in a different use case prior to the performance of this use case. Once these preconditions are established, the customer can perform the Create preliminary custom drone order use case. Normal Course The next major section of a use case is the description of the major steps that are performed to execute the response to the event, the inputs used for the steps, and the outputs produced by the steps. The normal course lists the steps that are performed when everything flows smoothly in the system. This is sometimes called the “happy path” because there are no problems or issues that arise when the steps can be followed normally. As you read through the steps, you can clearly understand the interactions that occur between the user and the system. The steps are listed in the order in which they are performed, and you can see the “bird’s-eye” perspective illustrated in the steps, describing what an outsider could observe while watching the user and system interact. Notice step 2, where a branching logical condition occurs. In this case, if the selected drone is out of stock, the customer is given the option of accepting the future availability date and continuing the order process. If that choice is rejected, the customer returns to step 1 to select a different drone model. Postconditions In this section of the use case, we define the final products of this use case. In our example, a confirmed order is stored in the Confirmed Custom Order datastore; an unconfirmed order is stored in the Unconfirmed Custom Order data store; and the shop manager is notified of a confirmed order requiring approval. These postconditions also serve to define the preconditions for the next use case in the series. In our example, that would be the use case that describes the Shop Manager’s custom order approval process. Exceptions To be complete, a use case should describe any error conditions or exceptions that may occur as the use case steps are performed. These are not normal branches in decision logic but are unusual occurrences or errors that could potentially be encountered and will lead to an unsuccessful result. As the use case is written and reviewed, the analyst should ask the user if there are any special situations or errors that could occur with each step. If there are, they should be explained as an exception. We want to be sure that the system does not fail while in use because of an error that no one thought about. As you probably know, in many systems, handling exceptions can require more coding effort than the normal and alternative courses. It is essential to try to identify for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Use Case Formats and Elements 117 these trouble spots during the analysis phase, so we do not encounter unexpected error conditions and crashes during testing and implementation. In our example, there are no exception conditions that have been identified. Use Cases in Sequence While it might be possible to describe everything in one large use case, that use case could become unwieldy. Therefore, it is common practice to create smaller, more focused use cases breaking the whole process down into parts. Consequently, it is important to know exactly what state the system should be in before the use case can begin and exactly what state the system should be in when the use case is complete. That is the purpose of the precondition and postcondition sections of the use case. In our example scenario, the use case depicted in Figure 4-1 was a part of the larger user goal of acquiring a customized drone. We chose to divide that major task into four use cases that are performed in a series so that each use case is less complex and does not become confusingly large. When we take this approach, the preconditions and postconditions are essential, since the state at the conclusion of Use Case 1 (its postconditions) are also the preconditions for Use Case 2 (our example use case), and the postconditions for Use Case 2 are the preconditions for Use Case 3. As Figure 4-2 shows, postconditions of a use case define the required system state (preconditions) for the subsequent use case, essentially establishing the boundaries of each use case. We often separate the overall user task into individual use cases to take advantage of the potential reusability of a use case. In our example, the need to authenticate the customer probably occurs in several places throughout the system. We do not need to develop new use cases each time this task is needed; we can simply reuse the use case we have already created. In situations like this, it is a good idea to add a notation on the use case describing the multiple places in the system that will utilize this use case. Additional Use Case Issues Some organizations may choose to include additional sections on their use case forms. If appropriate, it may be helpful to include sections devoted to: • Alternative paths • Summary of inputs and outputs • Frequency of use • Business rules • Special requirements • Assumptions • Notes and issues Acquiring a customized drone Preconditions Postconditions Preconditions Postconditions Preconditions Postconditions Preconditions Postconditions Authenticate customer Place custom drone order Obtain shop manager approval Transmit order to shop for customization FIGURE 4-2 Chain of use cases with boundaries. 118 Understanding Processes with Use Cases and Process Models These sections enable more detail to be listed about the use case as it is learned. More elaborate use cases are especially valuable when: • User representatives are not actively engaged with the development team throughout the project. • The application is complex and has a high risk associated with system failures. • Comprehensive test cases will be based on the user requirements. • Collaborating remote teams need a detailed, shared understanding of the user requirements.2 Applying Use Cases The use cases shown here are essential use cases, written to depict the user–system interactions as abstract, technology-independent steps. For example, in the first step of the Normal Course shown in Figure 4-1, “The customer selects base model drone from a list of models,” nothing is said about the specific way this is done. This phrasing keeps our options open in terms of how this task will be implemented. In the analysis phase, this is the correct perspective to take since we do not want our users to limit their thinking to just one way for the system to work too early in the process. Use Case Practical Tips Realistically, you should not expect to create a perfect use case on the first try. The process of building use cases is one of gradual refinement: As users and analysts work through the parts of the use case, they often return to previous parts to correct them. As you gain experience, the creation of use cases will become more intuitive. Being detailed and thorough will get you a long way toward a use case that contributes a significant understanding of the system that we are developing. Your focus should be on describing the user’s objectives in working with the system completely and accurately so that we will not have to rework the system later as it is being developed. Also, keep in mind that use cases are read and used by two quite different groups of people, the user/business experts and the system development experts. It is hard to find a middle ground writing style that will provide the precision needed by the development experts without overwhelming the users/business experts. Many organizations have found that use case writing teams are helpful. On the team, there should be at least one person who has a programming perspective to ensure adequate precision and accuracy in the use case; another person who has deep knowledge of the business rules that the system must enforce; and another person who is thoroughly familiar with how the system will actually be used. We create use cases when they are likely to help us better understand the situation and help convey the required user–system interactions. For simple processes that are well explained in the requirements definition, it is not necessary to create a use case. The information in the requirements definition itself is sufficient to describe what the system should do. It is important, however, to create use cases whenever we are reengineering processes or making any changes to business processes that will significantly alter the way people work. Remember that the use case describes what the system will do from the user’s perspective. Therefore, it is critical to involve 2  Karl E. Weigers, Software Requirements, 2nd ed. (Redmond, WA: Microsoft Press, 2003). for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Applying Use Cases 119 the user in the creation of the use case so that the user understands the interactions planned for the new system. Also, the user helps to ensure that no essential steps or tasks are omitted from the use case and that rare, special circumstances are included. Use Cases and Functional Requirements As we stated earlier in the chapter, use cases are helpful tools to use to understand user requirements. It is tempting for novice analysts, however, to incorrectly assume that the use case is all that is needed to fully define what the system must do. Use cases do explain the user’s interaction with the system, but they omit a lot of details that are necessary to know before the system can be developed. Use cases only convey the user’s point of view. Behind the scenes processing details are probably not included in the use case. Transforming the user’s view into the developer’s view by creating functional requirements is one of the important contributions that the systems analyst makes to the development project. Figure 4-3 lists functional requirements based on the Normal Course in the Place Custom Drone Order use case. As you can see, these requirements give more information to the developer about what the system must do to allow the user to accomplish his goals. Use Cases and Testing Many organizations develop test plans early in the development process. This strategy has many advantages, including giving the testing/quality assurance personnel an early understanding of the system under development. By studying the use cases and the functional requirements derived from them, the testing personnel can readily identify elements of the tests they will want to perform when the system enters testing. When the time comes to perform the tests, the testing personnel are well prepared and not forced to develop and perform the tests in a rush. In addition, the quality assurance personnel often can make helpful suggestions about the system and it is valuable to gain this feedback early in the development process. • The system displays a list of base drone models • The system accepts customer selection of base drone model • The system displays in stock/out of stock status for selected drone model • For an out-of-stock model, • The system displays the expected date of availability • The system asks customer to accept future date available and continue or to select a different drone model • The system displays optional features for the selected drone model (batteries, motors, cameras, sensors, etc.) • The system accepts user choices of options • The system displays summary and price of selected drone configuration • The system allows user to continue modifying the drone configuration, save the order for later, confirm the order, or exit without saving. • For orders saved without confirming, the system stores the order in the Unconfirmed Custom Order datastore • For confirmed orders, • The system displays a completed order summary for the customer • The system stores the order in the Confirmed Custom order • The system sends a notice of new Confirmed Custom order to the Shop Manager for approval FIGURE 4-3 Place custom drone order (normal course) functional requirements. 120 Understanding Processes with Use Cases and Process Models Creating Use Cases The most common ways to gather information for the use cases are through the same requirement determination techniques discussed in the previous chapter, especially interviews and JAD sessions. Observation also is sometimes used for as-is use cases. Regardless of whether interviews or JAD sessions are used, research shows that some ways to gather the information for use cases are better than others. The most effective process has four steps3 (Figure 4-4). These four steps are performed in order, but, of course, the analyst often cycles among them in an iterative fashion as he or she moves from use case to use case. Identify the Major Use Cases As stated previously, use cases document one or more functional requirements outlined in the requirements definition. Therefore, use cases are intricately linked with the requirements definition. The process-oriented functional requirements—things the system must do—suggest a direct action resulting from an external or temporal event. The information-oriented functional requirements—content the system must have—suggest things that happen involving information or time triggers to collect or produce information. Step Activities Typical Questions Askeda 1. Identify the use cases. Start a use case report form for each use case by filling in the name, description, and trigger. If there are more than nine use cases, group them into packages. Ask who, what, when, and where about the use cases (or tasks). What are the major tasks that are performed? What triggers this task? What tells you to perform this task? Ask how about each use case. What information/forms/reports do you need to perform this task? Who gives you these information/forms/reports? What information/forms/report does this produce and where do they go? How do you produce this report? How do you change the information on the report? How do you process forms? What tools do you use to do this step (e.g., paper, e-mail, phone)? Ask how about each step. How does the person know when to perform this step? What forms/reports/data does this step produce? What forms/reports/data does this step need? What happens when this form/report/data is not available? Ask the user to execute the process, using the written steps in the use case—that is, have the user role-play the use case. 2. Identify the major steps within each use case. For each use case, fill in the major steps needed to complete the task. 3. Identify elements within steps. For each step, identify its triggers and its inputs and outputs. 4. Confirm the use case. For each use case, validate that it is correct and complete. a We have used the typical questions for the as-is model (e.g., “What are the . . .”). These same questions can be used for the to-be model, but they would be phrased in the future tense (e.g., “What should be the . . .”). FIGURE 4-4 Steps for writing for use cases. 3  The approach in this section is based on the work of George Marakas and Joyce Elam, “Semantic Structuring in Analyst Acquisition and Representation of Facts in Requirements Analysis,” Information Systems Research, 1998, 9(1), 37–63, as well as our own: Alan Dennis, Glenda Hayes, and Robert Daniels, “Business Process Modeling with Group Support Systems,” Journal of Management Information Systems, 1999, 15(4): 115–142. for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Creating Use Cases 121 We will illustrate the process of creating use cases using the DrōnTeq Drone Sales System scenario. We have already seen a partial requirements definition for this situation (Figure 3-3). How was this information obtained? When the project to create this system began, the owners of DrōnTeq met with Sarah, a systems analyst for the company. This interview took place early in the project when Sarah was just getting familiar with the organization and Peter and Eric were envisioning how they wanted to conduct the business of selling their commercial drones. As Sarah conducted the interview with Peter and Eric, she looked for things that happen that cause activities to be performed. These things will be the major events of the system. Once an event is identified, try to discover the major response(s) to the event and how the response(s) are produced. Chances are, the details are obscure at this stage, but they can be discovered later by digging deeper. The interview gave Sarah quite a bit of information about the way the drone sales department should operate. The events she discovered suggest the primary things the users must accomplish with the system, and the responses describe the results of the activities performed when the event occurs. The event-response list prepared by Sarah is shown in Figure 4-5. In this example, we focus on the Drone Customization Shop Management area of the business. As shown in Figure 4-5, Sarah identified seven major events from her initial conversation with Peter and Eric. The first two events deal with receiving the shop work order from the Sales System and assigning the work order to a qualified technician. Events 3, 4, and 5 are associated with obtaining all needed components for the custom drone from the Inventory department. Finally, events 6 and 7 are focused on recording the start and completion times for the technician’s work on the drone. Sarah has also listed, in the Response column, the things that signify that the response to an event is concluded. As she reflected on events 3, 4, and 5, Sarah could see that these events are three parts of the overall user goal of obtaining all needed components for a drone customization work order. As shown in Figure 4-6, each event is an independent, but related part of the overall goal. After the use cases are identified, the top parts of the use case form should be filled in with name, ID, primary actor, short description, and trigger—it may be too early to assign the importance level of the use case. The goal is to develop a set of major use cases with the major information about each, rather than jumping into one use case and describing it completely. This prevents the users and analysts from forgetting key use cases and helps the users explain the overall set of business processes for which they are responsible. It also helps users understand how to describe the use cases and reduces the chance of overlap between use cases. In this step, the analysts and users identify a set of major use cases that could benefit from additional definition beyond the requirements definition. Event Response 1) New shop work order is received • Shop work order arrival time is recorded 2) Shop work order is assigned to qualified technician • Work order added to technician’s work assignment 3) Parts Request for base model drone and additional components generated • Parts request stored • Inventory department receives Parts Request 4) Requested parts arrive in Shop Parts room • Parts arrival recorded on Parts Request 5) All parts on a Parts Request are available • Technician notified that all parts are available 6) Technician records date/time work begins on work order • Shop work order updated with start date/time 7) Technician records completion of work on work order • Shop work order updated with completion date/time • Customer is notified of order completion FIGURE 4-5 Sample event-response list. A template for this figure is available on the student website. 122 Understanding Processes with Use Cases and Process Models Identifying use cases is an iterative process, with users often changing their minds about what a use case is and what it includes. It is quite easy to get trapped in the details at this point, so you need to remember that the goal at this step is to just identify the major use cases. The trick is to select the right size so that you end up with the major use cases that need additional explanation beyond the requirements definition. This does get easier with experience and practice. Remember that a use case is a set of end-to-end activities that starts with a trigger event and continues through many possible paths until some output has been produced and the system is again at rest. If the project team discovers more than eight or nine major use cases, this suggests that the system is complex (or that the use cases are not defined at the right level of detail). If there really are more than eight or nine major use cases, the use cases are grouped together into use case packages. For example, if we were to do a more thorough study of the Customization shop at DrōnTeq, we would likely find more than the seven events discussed in our example. The events leading to use cases could be grouped logically together in packages, such as all use cases for work orders, all use cases for parts requests, all use cases for work in process, etc. These packages are then treated as the major processes for the top level of the process model, with the use cases appearing on lower levels, or are treated as separate systems and modeled as separate systems. (Process modeling will be described next.) Since Sarah was focusing on three use cases, she prepared use case forms for each with the basic information on the top of the forms (Figure 4-7). She then began to complete the use cases by working with the customization shop manager. Identify the Major Steps for Each Use Case The next step is to complete the main body of the use case form. The users and analysts work together to describe the envisioned interactions between the user and the system to complete the response to the event. Before beginning a discussion of the steps, the analyst should ask the users what tasks need to be completed before the use case steps can begin. This helps clarify the preconditions that are necessary for the use case. Remember that the preconditions help define the starting state of the system. Record the preconditions in the proper section on the use case form. Next, the user–system interactions should be outlined as a series of steps in the Normal Course section of the form. The steps focus on what an independent observer would see the user and system do in response to the event. The users should concentrate on the steps that are followed when everything flows smoothly; however, make note of places where branches in logic may occur. In general, the steps should be listed in the order in which they are performed, from first to last, but there also may be steps that are performed only occasionally, have no formal sequence in which they are done, or loop back and forth. The order of steps implies a sequence but does not require it. It is fine to list steps that have no sequence in any order you like, but if there is a sequence, you should list the steps in that way. Each step should be about the same size as the others. For example, if we were writing steps for preparing a meal, steps such as “Take fork out of drawer” and “Put fork on table” are much Create Parts Request Obtain components needed for drone customization job Record receipt of component Finalize Parts Request Preconditions Postconditions Preconditions Postconditions Preconditions Postconditions FIGURE 4-6 Chain of use cases for obtaining drone components. for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Creating Use Cases 123 smaller than “Prepare cake, using mix.” If you end up with more than nine steps or steps that vary greatly in size, you must go back and adjust the steps. Recognizing the size of the steps takes practice but will become natural in time. One good approach to producing the steps for a use case is to have the users visualize themselves performing the use case and write down the steps as if they were writing a recipe for a cookbook. In most cases, the users will be able to quickly define what they do in as-is use cases. Defining the steps for to-be use cases may take a bit more coaching. In our experience, the descriptions of the steps change greatly as the users work through a use case. Our advice is to use an erasable blackboard or whiteboard (or paper with pencil) to develop the list of steps. Once the set of steps is fairly well defined, only then do you write it on the use case form. Occasionally, a use case is so simple that further refinement is not needed. The analyst simply writes a brief description and does not bother to develop the steps within the use case. The information at the top of the use case form is sufficient because the use case need not be explained in more detail. Some of the use cases presented in the exercises at the end of this chapter are simple enough that they do not need information beyond what is at the top of the use case form. Once the steps have been outlined at the proper level of detail, the postconditions can be completed. Ask the users how they know they are finished with a task. What are the tangible results of performing the steps just listed? Record these in the Postconditions section of the form.

In the workshop, the participants began by describing the initial state of the system. Sarah asked them to think about what needed to be accomplished before the use case steps could begin. Then, she asked them to describe how they envisioned working with the system to complete the task. Sarah was careful to guide them to think in terms of essential steps that did not assume a particular form of system implementation. Since the goal was to describe the user–system interactions in a new system, Sarah also helped the participants think of what could be done using technology. After several revisions, the team settled on the partial use cases shown in Figure 4-8. Notice as you look at the examples in Figure 4-8 FIGURE 4-8 Major use cases with steps completed.

Sarah’s chosen use case style is suitable for her situation and is sufficient to provide the detail that her team requires. Identify Elements within Steps The use case forms in Figure 4-8 require some final work before they are complete. The last column (“Information for Steps”) must be completed, and arrows may be drawn to describe inputs and outputs from the steps. The goal at this point is to identify the major inputs and outputs for each step. One could identify the inputs and outputs in detail, but this would make it difficult to list them concisely in the summary area at the bottom of this use case form. In our example, we have chosen to refer to the inputs and outputs in broad terms. For example, if a step needs the customer name, address, and phone number, we might note these in the step description but list only “customer information” as the major input at the bottom of the form. The users and analysts now return to the steps in the use case and begin tracing the flow of the steps. Typically, this means asking what inputs (e.g., information, forms, reports) are used by each step or what outputs it produces. These are written in the last column on the use case form, with an arrow pointing into or out of a step (Figure 4-9). Sometimes, forms, reports, and information will flow from one step to the next to the next; these can be shown by arrows pointing from step to step. It is not unusual at this point for users to discover that they forgot to list the entire steps during their first time through the use case. These previously omitted steps are simply added to a revised use case. Our experience has shown that users can forget to include seldom-used activities that occur in special cases (e.g., when data is not available or when something unexpected Use Case Name: Finalize Parts Request ID: UC-5 Priority: High Actor: Shop Parts Room clerk Description: This use case describes how the Parts Room clerk finalizes a Parts Request Trigger: Notification received that all parts are available for a Parts Request Preconditions: 1.

Remember our process of gradual refinement; it applies to the creation of the use cases. In our example shown in Figure 4-9, you will notice some steps added in Use Case UC-4, step 2. Here, some steps were added to show how to handle receipt of an incorrect or damaged part. The Summary area for inputs and outputs found at the end of the use case form is completed once the team is satisfied with the steps, inflows, and outflows listed previously. In this section, all the input flows are listed in the left-most column and their source is specified in the adjacent column. In the third column, all the output flows are listed, and their destination is specified in the right-most column. As we have mentioned, this summary area allows the team to easily view all the inputs that must be included to complete the use case and all the outputs that will be produced by the use case. This area of the use case form will be especially useful if the team decides to depict the system with data flow diagrams.

The Campus Housing Service helps students find apartments. Owners of apartments fill in information forms about the rental units they have available (e.g., location, number of bedrooms, monthly rent), which are entered into a database. Students can search through this database via the Web to find apartments that meet their needs (e.g., a two-bedroom apartment for $800 or less per month within ½ mile of campus). They then contact the apartment owners directly to see the apartment and possibly rent it. Apartment owners call the service to delete their listing when they have rented their apartment(s). In building the major use cases, follow the four-step process: identify the use cases, identify the steps within them, identify the elements within the steps, and confirm the use cases. YOUR TURN 4-1 Campus Housing 128 Understanding Processes with Use Cases and Process Models Confirm the Use Case The final step is for the users to confirm that the use case is correct as written. Review the use case with the users to make sure that each step and each input and output are correct and that the result of the use case is consistent with the result in the event-response list. The most powerful approach is to ask the user to role-play or execute the use case by using the written steps in the use case. The analyst will hand the user pieces of paper labeled as the major inputs to the use case. The user follows the written steps like a recipe to make sure that those steps and inputs really can produce the outputs and result defined for the use case. Review the initial DrōnTeq Customization Shop Management functional requirement 2-1  in Figure  3-3. Now, based on your study of UC-3 in Figure 4-9, revise the list of functional requirements to provide more clarity and detail for the task of preparing a Parts Request. YOUR TURN 4-2 Functional Requirements for DrōnTeq Create a Parts Request Several years ago, a well-known national real estate company built a computer-based system to help its real estate agents sell houses more quickly. The system, which worked in many ways like an early version of realtor.com, enabled its agents to search the database of houses for sale to find houses matching the buyer’s criteria using a much easier interface than the traditional system. The system also enabled the agent to show the buyer a virtual tour of selected houses listed by the company itself. It was believed that by more quickly finding a small set of houses more closely matching the buyer’s desires, and by providing a virtual tour, the buyers (and the agent) would waste less time looking at unappealing houses. This would result in happier buyers and in agents who were able to close sales more quickly, leading to more sales for the company and higher commissions for the agent. The system was designed with input from agents from around the country and was launched with great hoopla. The initial training of agents met with a surge of interest and satisfaction among the agents, and the project team received many congratulations. Six months later, satisfaction with the system had dropped dramatically, absenteeism had increased by 300%, and agents were quitting in record numbers; turnover among agents had risen by 500%, and in exit interviews, many agents mentioned the system as the primary reason for leaving. The company responded by eliminating the system—with great embarrassment. One of an agent’s key skills was the ability to find houses that match the buyer’s needs. The system destroyed the value of this skill by providing a system that could enable less skilled agents to perform almost as well as highly skilled ones. Worse still—from the viewpoint of the agent—the buyer could interact directly with the system, thus bypassing the “expertise” of the agent. Questions 1. How were the problems with the system missed? 2. How might these problems have been foreseen and possibly avoided? 3. In perfect hindsight, given the widespread availability of such systems on the Internet today, what should the company have done?

YOUR TURN 4-3 Functional Requirements for DrōnTeq Obtain Component Parts for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Applying the Concepts at DrōnTeq 129 Revise Functional Requirements Based on Use Cases We have stressed in our discussion that developing use cases enables the project team to clarify and outline in detail the user–system interaction that is needed in the new system. As a result, the system to be developed is better understood. The functional requirements in the requirements definition may be modified to reflect this more detailed understanding and to provide insight to the development team on some “back-end” processing that will be needed that may not be obvious from the use cases alone. Applying the Concepts at DrōnTeq Identifying the Major Use Cases The first step in creating the use cases is to identify the major use cases according to the requirements definition, which was developed in the last chapter and shown in Figure 3-12. Take a minute and carefully read the requirements definition. Identify the major use cases that you think need additional definition before you continue reading. It is important that you think about the use cases before you read what we have to say about them. So, if you have not tried to do this, take five minutes now and do it. We will wait. The information in the functional requirements definition sometimes just flows into the use cases, but it usually requires some thought as to how to structure the use cases. Creating an eventresponse list often helps to clarify the number and scope of the use cases (Figure 4-10). Looking closely about these requirements, we can see the first two deal with clients and pilots who wish to learn more about the flight services DrōnTeq offers and the Pilot partnership program, respectively. The third and fourth events deal with establishing formal client and pilot relationships with DrōnTeq. While these events are essential to the Client Services business unit, none of them are inherently complex. The remaining five events on the list deal with specific aspects of flight request operations. Jiang wants to focus on these elements carefully, for these will be the operational foundation for the new business unit. Event Response Requirements • Client wants to learn about services • Flight services and data analyses displayed 1.1–1.3 • Pilots wants to learn about Pilot Partnership program • Pilot Partnership details displayed 5.1–5.2 • Client creates account • New client account and profile created 2.1–2.3 • Pilot creates Pilot Partnership Agreement • Pilot Partnership completed 6.1–6.4 • Client requests drone flight • Open Drone Flight Request created 3.1–3.2 • Pilot receives drone flight assignment • Flight assigned to pilot 7.1–7.4, 3.3 • Client wants to view status of open flight requests • Flight request status displayed 4.1 • Flight is completed • Flight sensor data uploaded; data analyses initiated; customer notified; flight request closed 8.1–8.3, 4.2 • Client requests more data analysis for completed flights • Data analyses initiated 4.5 FIGURE 4-10 DrōnTeq Client Services event-response list. 130 Understanding Processes with Use Cases and Process Models Jiang scheduled a meeting with Carmella to discuss her ideas on how these five events should be handled in the new system. Carmella was able to create outlines of three of the event handling processes easily. Together, she and Jiang created brief descriptions of how clients would request a drone flight, how clients would review the status of open flight requests, and how clients could request additional data analyses for a completed drone flight. The ways to handle events dealing with the assignment of flights to pilots and the completion of a flight were less clear, however, and Jiang and Carmella decided to use a JAD session to further clarify those aspects of the new system. Carmella invited DrōnTeq owners, Eric and Peter, to the JAD session, along with her assistant manager and two commercial drone pilots who were expected to participate in the new Client Services program. Elaborating on the Use Cases During the JAD sessions, the team followed the steps of the process we outlined earlier in the chapter. For each use case, the primary actor and trigger were identified, and a brief description was written. The next step was to define the major steps for each use case. The goal at this point is to describe how the use case operates. Jiang asked the JAD team to visualize how each of these events would be handled with the support of an information system, individually, and then collectively as a group. The team also considered experiences they had with other systems to get ideas for how to handle these events. The techniques of visualizing your interaction with the process and thinking about how other systems work (informal benchmarking) are important techniques that help analysts and users understand how processes work and how to write the use cases. Both visualization and informal benchmarking are commonly used in practice. As the JAD team discussed the process to assign a flight request to a pilot, they realized that this event encompassed three events with narrower scope that are performed in sequence. First, the new flight request triggers an event to notify pilots of the new flight request and open the bidding process. Second, pilots submit bids for the flight request until the bidding window closes. Third, when the bidding window closes, the bids are analyzed, and the winning bid is selected and awarded the flight. As the team discussed this process, they also recognized that awarding the winning bid would not be a fully automatic process as originally conceived. Eric, Peter, and Carmella felt that it would be important to have a human involved in reviewing all pilot bids to ensure that the winning bid was awarded to a pilot/drone that were fully capable of providing all the services associated with a flight request. For example, a client might request a drone flight using an infrared sensor, and not all drones are equipped with such sensors. In addition, several “Exception” conditions were discovered that needed human intervention. Based on this discussion, the role of Flight Operations Manager was developed. This position will play a key role in the final assignment of a flight to a pilot, with considerable assistance from the information system being developed. Creating the Flight Operations Manager role was a direct outcome of the JAD team working through use case development for this new business area. By thinking carefully about the process needed to respond to a business event, the team recognized areas where human/system interaction was needed. Prior to the JAD session, there was uncertainty about the exact nature of this process. That uncertainty was resolved because of the JAD team’s work. The team added more detail to the use case steps by identifying their inputs and outputs. This means identifying the inputs needed to complete the step (e.g., information, forms, reports) and the outputs produced by each step. Alternative branches in logic were discussed and the team looked for error conditions that might occur. As the inputs and outputs were described, they were written in the summary area at the end of the form. Once all the use cases had been defined, the final step in the JAD session was to confirm that they were accurate. The project team had the users role-play the use cases. A few minor problems were discovered and easily fixed. for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Applying the Concepts at DrōnTeq 131 FIGURE 4-11 DrōnTeq use cases.

With considerable input from the two pilots on the team, an outline of the response process was developed for this event. The formality of a use case was not required after all, as the team determined that the steps needed to record completing a flight were straightforward. Figure 4-11 shows the completed use cases. We limit the focus here to the three use cases that, together, enable a flight request to be assigned to a pilot. Refer to these use cases as you read the remaining material in this chapter. Can you follow the steps? Do they seem logical? If you find something that you think may be missing, remember that use cases are created with gradual refinement, and errors and omissions can be corrected as they are discovered. Also, we have purposely tried to avoid getting lost in the details. Our goal is to include the major activities that are performed, but not necessarily every tiny detail at this point. 132 Understanding Processes with Use Cases and Process Models Notify Pilots of New Flight Request (UC-2A) For this use case, the trigger is the submission of a new Flight Request by a client (described in a separate use case for that event). The system uses the details of the new flight request to create a flight proximity region, which is defined as a circular area with a radius of 75 miles from the flight’s geographic location. The system then uses pilot geographic location data to identify all pilots within the flight proximity region. If no pilots are found within the flight proximity area, the system extends the radius by 25 miles and recalculates the flight proximity region until the region includes one or more pilots. The system sends notification of the new Flight Request to these pilots and their dashboards are updated with the flight information and bidding window. The Flight Request notification record is saved and stored. Pilot Submits Bid (UC-2B) This use case is performed by a pilot who wants to submit a bid for a flight request. The pilot uses the pilot dashboard to review the details of the flight request. A Flight Bid form can be completed and submitted by the pilot, listing the details of the pilot’s bid on the flight.

Select Winning Flight Bid (UC-2C) This use case is triggered by the closing of the flight bid window. The flight bid window is opened when pilots are notified of a new flight request (UC-2A) and remains open for a specific time period. When that time period has elapsed, this use case is performed; hence, this is an example of a temporal event.

The Flight Operations Manager then reviews the list of bids and eliminates any bids that came in from pilots who do not have drones with the required capabilities for the flight. The system then ranks the remaining flight bids based on an optimal combination of time frame and price. The Flight Operations Manager selects the more favorable bid. The system then updates the Flight Bid records and the Flight Request record and notifies pilots and the customer of the results of the bidding process. If no bids were received during the bidding window, the Flight Operations Manager can perform UC-2A, modifying the flight proximity area and/or the pricing guidelines for the Flight Request and reposting the Flight Request. Data Flow Diagrams Data flow diagramming is a technique that diagrams the business processes and the data that pass among them. We use data flow diagrams (DFDs) to describe the to-be system’s interactions with its environment, processes, flows of data, and data stores. In this section, we first describe the basic syntax rules and illustrate how they are used to draw simple one-page DFDs. Then we describe how to create more complex multipage diagrams. Although the name DFD implies a focus on data, this is not the case. The focus is mainly on the processes or activities that are performed. Data modeling, discussed in the next chapter, describes how the data created and used by processes are organized. Process modeling—and creating DFDs in particular—is one of the most important skills needed by systems analysts. In this section, we focus on logical process models, which are models that describe processes, without suggesting how they are conducted. When reading a logical process model, you will not be able to tell whether a process is computerized or manual, whether a piece of information is collected by paper form or via the Web, or whether information is placed in a filing cabinet or a large database. These physical details are defined during the design phase when these logical models are refined into physical models, which provide information that is needed to ultimately build the system. (See Chapter 9.) By focusing on logical processes first, analysts can focus on how the business should run, without being distracted by implementation details. In this chapter, we first explain how to read DFDs and describe their basic syntax. Then we describe the process used to build DFDs that draws information from the use cases and from additional requirements information gathered from the users. Reading Data Flow Diagrams Figure 4-12 shows a DFD for an event we introduced earlier in the chapter, that of the shop manager approving a custom drone order. By examining the DFD, an analyst can understand the process by which the shop manager assesses the custom drone order. Take a moment to examine the diagram before reading on. How much do you understand? Most people from Western cultures start reading diagrams from left to right, top to bottom. So, whenever possible, this is where most analysts try to make the DFD begin. The item on the left side of Figure 4-12 is the “Shop Manager” external entity, which is a rectangle that represents the person/role responsible for approving custom drone orders. This symbol has five arrows pointing away from it to rounded rectangular symbols. These arrows represent data flows and show that the external entity (shop manager) provides five “bundles” of data to processes that use the data. Also, there are several arrows arriving at the shop manager external entity from the rounded rectangles, representing bundles of data that the processes produce to flow back to the shop manager. A use case for the Approve Custom Drone Order event would show these same input/output data bundles with the source/destination listed as the shop manager. for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Data Flow Diagrams 135 Customer Service Department Shop Manager Customer 7.5 Create Shop Work Order 7.3 Reconfigure Drone 7.2 Verify Drone Configuration 7.4 Process Customer Approval 7.1 Retrieve Order Details D1 Custom Drone Orders D2 Drone Components D4 Shop Work Orders D3 Unapproved Modified Drone Orders Order ID Order Details Custom Drone Components Verification Results Drone Order Drone Component Details Part to Replace Alternative Drone Component Alternative Component Alternative Component Selection Modified Drone Order Modified Drone Order Order Change Approval Request Order Change Approval Response Approved Drone Configuration Change Order Cancellation Customer Response Final Drone Configuration Order Approval Notice Approved Custom Order Order Cancellation Notice Shop Work Order Component ID Component ID FIGURE 4-12 Shop manager approval of custom drone order level 1 DFD. 136 Understanding Processes with Use Cases and Process Models Now look at the arrow that flows in to the “Retrieve Order Details” process from the right side. To approve the custom drone order, the process must retrieve some information from data storage. The open-ended rectangle labeled “Custom Drone Orders” is called a data store, and it represents a collection of stored data. The “Retrieve Order Details” process uses an identifier for the custom drone order to find the order details and provide them to the shop manager. Note that every major input listed in a use case flows into a process from an external entity or stored data. Also notice that every major output listed in a use case flows out to a destination (an external entity or data storage) on the DFD. The Major Steps Performed section of a use case provides insight to the processes that are needed to respond to the event. On the DFD, these steps have been organized into five major processes, each performing one main component of the interactions included on the use case. On the DFD (Figure 4-12), as you follow the arrows starting with “Order ID” from the shop manager to the “Retrieve Order Details” process, imagine the shop manager specifying the ID for the order he must approve. The system retrieves the order details. Using the custom components on the drone order, the shop manager submits the drone configuration to the “Verify Drone Configuration” process. Information about the custom drone components is retrieved from data storage and used to perform the weight and balance check and the battery check for the custom drone. The system returns the results of these verification checks to the shop manager. If problems are found, the shop manager can search for alternative components. He can rerun the “Verify Drone Configuration” process as needed until the modified custom configuration passes those verification checks. After making changes to the drone configuration that pass the verification checks, the modified drone order is stored temporarily while the customer is contacted for approval of the order change. If the customer accepts the change, the changes are recorded in the custom drone order data store and the shop manager is notified of the customer’s approval. If the customer does not approve the change, the order is canceled, and the Customer Service Department is notified of the cancellation so that a follow-up contact can be made. Look at the remaining process symbol in the DFD and examine its inflows and outflows. Based on the data flowing in and flowing out, try to understand what the process is doing. You probably recognized that the “Create Shop Work Order” process (7.5) uses the final drone configuration to create and store a new Shop Work Order. The customer is notified of the shop manager’s approval and the custom drone order data store is updated with the approval status. As you learn to read DFDs, it is important to remember that these diagrams are not the same as program flowcharts. On a DFD, the processes are performed by the actor as needed. In most cases, the custom drone configurations will successfully pass the verification checks in process 7.2 and the shop manager will immediately create the shop work order using process 7.5. Processes 7.3 and 7.4 are only used when a custom drone configuration fails a verification check and requires modification. An event’s use case and a DFD (such as Figure  4-12) are purposefully related. A wellconstructed use case makes developing a DFD quite straightforward, although the analyst will have to make some decisions about how much detail to depict in the DFD. The steps outlined in a use case can be organized into logical processes on a DFD. The Major Inputs and Major Outputs listed on the use case provide a list of the sources and destinations, respectively, of the inflows and outflows of the processes. The Information for Steps section shows the data flowing in or produced by each step of the use case, and these correspond to the data flows that enter or leave each process on the DFD. Elements of Data Flow Diagrams Now that you have had a glimpse of a DFD, we will present the language of DFDs, which includes a set of symbols, naming conventions, and syntax rules. There are four symbols in the for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Data Flow Diagrams 137 DFD language (processes, data flows, data stores, and external entities), each of which is represented by a different graphic symbol. There are two commonly used styles of symbols, one set developed by Chris Gane and Trish Sarson and the other by Tom DeMarco and Ed Yourdon4 (Figure 4-13). Neither is better than the other; some organizations use the Gane and Sarson style of symbols, and others use the DeMarco/Yourdon style. We will use the Gane and Sarson style in this book. Process A process is an activity or a function that is performed for some specific business reason. Processes can be manual or computerized. Every process should be named starting with a verb and ending with a noun (e.g., “Create shop work order”). Names should be short yet contain enough information so that the reader can easily understand exactly what they do. In general, Data Flow Diagram Element Typical Computer-Aided Software Engineering Fields Gane and Sarson Symbol DeMarco and Yourdon Symbol Every process has a number a name (verb phase) a description at least one output data flow at least one input data flow Every data ow has a name (a noun) a description one or more connections to a process Every data store has a number a name (a noun) a description one or more input data flows one or more output data flows Every external entity has a name (a noun) a description Label (name) Type (process) Description (what is it) Process number Process description (structured English) Notes Label (name) Type (flow) Description Alias (another name) Composition (description of data elements) Notes Label (name) Type (store) Description Alias (another name) Composition (description of data elements) Notes Label (name) Type (entity) Description Alias (another name) Entity description Notes Name Name Name Name Name Name 1 D1 Name D1 Name FIGURE 4-13 Data flow diagram elements. 4  See Chris Gane and Trish Sarson, Structured Systems Analysis: Tools and Techniques, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1979; Tom DeMarco, Structured Analysis and System Specification, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1979; and E. Yourdon and Larry L. Constantine, Structured Design: Fundamentals of a Discipline of Computer Program and Systems Design, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1979. 138 Understanding Processes with Use Cases and Process Models each process performs only one activity, so most systems analysts avoid using the word “and” in process names because it suggests that the process performs several activities. In addition, every process must have at least one input data flow and at least one output data flow. Figure 4-13 shows the basic elements of a process and how they are usually named in CASE tools. Every process has a unique identification number, a name, and a description, all of which are noted in the CASE repository. Descriptions clearly and precisely describe the steps and details of the processes; ultimately, they are used to guide the programmers who need to write the software that implements the processes (or the writers of procedure manuals for noncomputerized processes). The process descriptions become more detailed as information is learned about the process through the analysis phase. Many process descriptions are written as simple text statements about what happens. More complex processes use more formal techniques such as structured English, decision tables, or decision trees, which are discussed in a later section. Data Flow A data flow is a single fact, such as Order ID (sometimes called a data element), or a logical collection of several facts (e.g., new shop work order). Every data flow should be named with a noun. The description of a data flow lists exactly what data elements the flow contains. For example, the order details data flow would list customer information, order date, base model drone, and the custom components included in the order as its data elements. Data flows are the glue that holds the processes together. One end of every data flow will always come from or go to a process, with the arrow showing the direction into or out of the process. Data flows show what inputs go into each process and what outputs each process produces. Every process must create at least one output data flow, because if there is no output, the process does not do anything. Likewise, each process has at least one input data flow, because it is difficult, if not impossible, to produce an output with no input. Data Store A data store is a collection of data that is stored in some way (which is determined later when creating the physical model). Every data store is named with a noun and is assigned an identification number and a description. Data stores form the starting point for the data model (discussed in the next chapter) and form the logical connection between the process model and the data model. Data flows coming out of a data store indicate that information is retrieved from the data store. Looking at Figure 4-12, you can see that process 7.1 (Retrieve Order Details) retrieves the Order Details data flow from the Custom Drone Orders data store. Similarly, process 7.2 (Verify Drone Configuration) retrieves the Drone Component Details data flow from the Drone Components data store. Data flows going into a data store indicate that information is added to the data store. For example, process 7.5 adds a Shop Work Order data flow to the Shop Work Orders data store. Finally, data flows going both into and out of a data store indicate that information in the data store is changed (e.g., by retrieving data from a data store, changing it, and storing it back). In Figure 4-12, we can see that process 7.4 (Process Customer Approval) modifies the existing content of the Custom Drone Orders data store with configuration changes that were approved by the customer. All data stores must have at least one input data flow (or else they never contain any data) unless they are created and maintained by another information system or on another page of the DFD. In Figure 4-12, the Drone Components data store supplies data to two processes (7.2 and 7.3) but its content is not changed. This is perfectly fine, but before the system analyst is finished, it is important to ensure that processes are included somewhere that allow data to be added, modified, and deleted from this data store. Likewise, data stores must have at least one output data flow on some page of the DFD. (Why store data if you never use it?) In cases in which the same for more ebook/ testbank/ solution manuals requests: email 960126734@qq.com Data Flow Diagrams 139 process both stores data and retrieves data from a data store, there is a temptation to draw one data flow with an arrow on both ends. This practice is incorrect, however. The data flow that stores data and the data flow that retrieves data should always be shown as two separate data flows. External Entity An external entity is a person, organization, organization unit, or system that is external to the system, but interacts with it (e.g., customer, clearinghouse, government organization, accounting system). The external entity typically corresponds to the primary actor identified in the use case. External entities provide data to the system or receive data from the system and serve to establish the system boundaries. Every external entity has a name and a description. The key point to remember about an external entity is that it is external to the system but may or may not be part of the organization. People who use the information from the system to perform other processes or who decide what information goes into the system are documented as external entities (e.g., managers, staff). Using Data Flow Diagrams to Define Business Processes Most business processes are too complex to be explained in one DFD. Most process models are therefore composed of a set of DFDs. The first DFD provides a summary of the overall system, with additional DFDs providing more and more detail about each part of the overall business process. Thus, one important principle in process modeling with DFDs is the decomposition of the business process into a hierarchy of DFDs, with each level down the hierarchy consisting of diagrams with less scope but more detail. Figures 4-14 and 4-15 show how one business process can be decomposed into several levels of DFDs.

As the name suggests, the context diagram shows the entire system in context with its environment. All process models have one context diagram.

Data stores are not included on the context diagram. If the system uses data from or supplies data to another independent information system, that system should be shown as an external entity, not a data store. Level 0 Diagram The next level in the DFD hierarchy is the diagram called the level 0 diagram or level 0 DFD (Figure 4-14). The level 0 diagram shows all the major processes at the first level of numbering (i.e., processes numbered 1 through 3), the data stores, external entities, and data flows among them. The purpose of the level 0 DFD is to show all the major high-level processes of the system and how they relate to each other and to stored data. All process models have one and only one level 0 DFD. The three processes, two data stores, and seven data flows shown in the level 0 diagram are contained within process 0. They were not shown on the context diagram because they are internal components of process 0. The context diagram deliberately hides some of the system’s complexity in order to make it easier for the reader to understand. Only after the reader understands the context diagram does the analyst “open up” process 0 to display its internal operations by decomposing the context diagram into the level 0 DFD, which shows more detail about the processes, data stores, and data flows inside the system. Another key principle in creating sets of DFDs is balancing. Balancing means ensuring that all information presented in a DFD at one level is accurately represented in the next-level DFD. This does not mean that the information is identical, but that it is shown appropriately. There is a subtle difference in meaning between these two words that will become apparent shortly, but for the moment, let us compare the context diagram with the level 0 DFD in Figure 4-14 to see how the two are balanced. In this case, we see that the external entities (A, B, C) are identical between the two diagrams and that the data flows to and from the external entities in the context diagram (V, W, X, Y, Z) also appear on the level 0 DFD. The level 0 DFD replaces the context diagram’s single process (always numbered 0) with three processes (1, 2, 3), adds two data stores (D1, D2), and includes several additional data flows that were not on the context diagram (look for data flows A, B, C, D, E, F, and G). Level 1 Diagrams In the same way that the context diagram deliberately hides some of the system’s complexity, so, too, does the level 0 DFD. The level 0 DFD shows only how the major high-level processes in the system interact. Each process on the level 0 DFD must be decomposed into a more explicit DFD, called a level 1 diagram, or level 1 DFD, which shows how it operates in greater detail. The DFD illustrated in Figure 4-12 is a level 1 DFD. In general, all process models have as many level 1 diagrams as there are processes on the level 0 diagram; every process in the level 0 DFD would be decomposed into its own level 1 DFD. Therefore, the level 0 DFD in Figure 4-14 would have three level 1 DFDs (one for process 1, one for process 2, one for process 3). In Figure 4-15, we show three new diagrams, the level 1 DFDs for each process that was shown in the level 0 diagram. The processes in the level 1 diagram are the children of the parent process in the level 0 diagram. The set of children and the parent are identical; they are simply different ways of looking at the same thing. When a parent process is decomposed into children processes, its children must completely perform all its functions, in the same way that cutting up a pie produces a set of slices that wholly and completely make up the pie. Even though the slices may not be the same size, the set of slices is identical to the entire pie; nothing is omitted by slicing the pie. You can appreciate the value of the hierarchy of diagrams in this simple example. We have shown that the entire system can be represented by three major processes. These three major 142 Understanding Processes with Use Cases and Process Models processes are further decomposed into ten smaller processes represented on the three level 1 diagrams. Ten processes on one diagram would be messy and difficult to understand, but carefully decomposing in the hierarchy of diagrams keeps each diagram less complex and easier to understand. That is the essence of the hierarchy of DFDs found in the process model. Once again, it is important to ensure that the level 0 and level 1 DFDs are balanced. For example, the level 0 DFD shows that process 1 receives data flow V from Entity A and produces two output data flows. One output data flow (A) is sent to data store D1 and the other (B) is sent to process 2. A check of the level 1 DFD shows the same entity, data store, and data flows. We also see that two new data flows have been added (H, I) at this level. These data flows are contained within process 1 and therefore are not documented in the level 0 DFD. Only when we decompose or open up process 1 via the level 1 DFD do we see that they exist. The level 1 DFD shows more precisely which process uses the input data flow V (process 1.1) and which produces the output data flows A and B (processes 1.2 and 1.3). Take a moment and look carefully at the data flows surrounding process 2 and process 3 in the level 0 diagram. Verify that these data flows have been carried down to the respective level 1 diagrams correctly. Also note the new level of detail that can be seen in these two level 1 diagrams that was hidden in the level 0 diagram. When decomposing a process into its child level DFD, some CASE and drawing tools carry only the input and output data flows down to the child diagram. To find the exact source and destination of data flows, one often must follow the data flow across several DFDs on different diagrams. To simplify reading the diagrams, we like to show the external entities on all levels of the DFDs and commonly add a text notation that explains a data flow’s destination to another process. Level 2 Diagrams and Below If any of the processes in the level 1 diagram appear to be “busy” with multiple inflows and outflows, it may be appropriate to decompose that process into a child diagram. The next level under level 1 would be labeled as level 2, and so forth. The ultimate goal is to decompose a process so that each child process performs one essential task, not multiple tasks. It is sometimes difficult to remember which DFD level is which. It may help to remember that the level numbers refer to the number of periods in the process numbers on the DFD. A level 0 DFD has process numbers with no periods (e.g., 1, 2), whereas a level 1 DFD has process numbers with one period (e.g., 2.3, 5.1), a level 2 DFD has numbers with two periods (e.g.,1.2.5, 3.3.2), and so on. Alternative Data Flows Suppose that a process produces two different data flows under different circumstances. For example, a quality-control process could produce a quality-approved widget or a defective widget, or in Figure 4-12, the customer may or may not approve the order modification. How do we show these alternative paths in the DFD? The answer is that we show both data flows and use the process description to explain that they are alternatives. Nothing on the DFD itself shows that the data flows are mutually exclusive. For example, in Figure 4-15, process 2.3 on the level 1 DFD produces two output data flows (E and L). Without reading the underlying process description of process 2.3, we do not know whether these are produced simultaneously or whether they are mutually exclusive. The process description shown in Figure 4-16 reveals that these two data flows are indeed alternative data flows. Process Descriptions The purpose of process descriptions is to explain what the process does and provide additional information that the DFD does not provide (see Figure 4-16).

In most cases, a process is straightforward enough that the requirements definition, a use case, and a DFD with a simple text description together provide sufficient detail to support the activities in the design phase. Sometimes, however, the process is sufficiently complex that it can benefit from a more detailed process description that explains the logic that occurs inside the process. Three techniques are commonly used to describe more complex processing logic: structured English, decision trees, and decision tables. Complex processes may use a combination of structured English and either decision trees or decision tables. Structured English uses short sentences to describe the work that a process performs. Decision trees display decision logic (IF statements) as a set of nodes (questions) and branches (answers). Decision tables represent complex policy decisions as
