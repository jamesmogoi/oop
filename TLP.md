what the optimal most optimal to charge my lenovo

Here are the most optimal charging practices for your Lenovo laptop:

üîã Optimal Charging Strategy
1. Keep Battery Between 20-80%

Don't let it drop below 20%
Don't charge it to 100% constantly
The 20-80% range maximizes battery lifespan
2. Use Lenovo's Battery Conservation Mode Lenovo has a built-in feature that stops charging at 60% (optimal for longevity):

On Windows:

Install Lenovo Vantage app
Go to Power settings
Enable "Conservation Mode"
On Linux (Fedora):

bash
# Install TLP for battery management
sudo dnf install tlp tlp-rdw

# Enable and start TLP
sudo systemctl enable tlp
sudo systemctl start tlp

# Set charge thresholds (if supported)
sudo tlp-stat -b  # Check if thresholds are supported
For Lenovo on Linux, you can set thresholds:

bash
# Stop charging at 80%, start at 40%
echo 80 | sudo tee /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold
echo 40 | sudo tee /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_start_threshold
3. Optimal Daily Use:

Plugged in at desk? Enable Conservation Mode (60%) or set 80% limit
Mobile use? Charge to 80-90%, unplug
Long-term storage? Charge to 50-60% and power off
‚ö° Charging Best Practices
Do:

Use the original Lenovo charger (or certified equivalent)
Charge in a cool environment (heat degrades batteries)
Unplug when doing light work if already at 80%+
Calibrate battery every 2-3 months (full discharge to 0%, then full charge to 100%)
Don't:

Leave plugged in at 100% 24/7 (causes battery degradation)
Charge in hot environments (>35¬∞C / 95¬∞F)
Use cheap third-party chargers
Let it discharge to 0% regularly
üìä Specific Scenarios
Working from home (plugged in all day):

Best: Conservation Mode at 60%
Good: Charge limit at 80%
Mixed use (desk + mobile):

Charge to 80% in morning
Unplug and use throughout day
Recharge when hits 20-30%
Gaming/Heavy workload:

Keep plugged in (performance needs consistent power)
Use 80% threshold if available
üõ†Ô∏è For Fedora - Install TLP (Recommended)
bash
# Install TLP
sudo dnf install tlp tlp-rdw

# Enable TLP
sudo systemctl enable tlp
sudo systemctl start tlp

# Edit TLP config for Lenovo optimization
sudo nano /etc/tlp.conf
```

Add these lines:
```
START_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=40
STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=80
Save and restart TLP:

bash
sudo tlp start
üéØ Bottom Line
Most Optimal Setup:

Install Lenovo Vantage (Windows) or TLP (Linux)
Set charge limit to 80% (or 60% if mostly plugged in)
Avoid letting battery drop below 20%
Keep laptop cool while charging
This will double or triple your battery's lifespan compared to leaving it plugged in at 100% constantly.

What's your typical usage pattern? I can give you a more specific recommendation!


60 is the absolute

You're absolutely right - 60% is the absolute sweet spot for maximum battery longevity, especially if you keep your Lenovo plugged in most of the time.

üéØ Why 60% is Optimal
Science behind it:

Lithium-ion batteries degrade fastest at high charge states
60% minimizes stress on the battery cells
Keeps voltage in the "safe zone" (around 3.8-3.9V per cell)
Perfect balance between usability and longevity
Lenovo knows this - that's why their Conservation Mode defaults to exactly 60%!

‚ö° Set Up 60% Charging on Fedora
Method 1: TLP (Recommended)

bash
# Install TLP
sudo dnf install tlp tlp-rdw

# Enable it
sudo systemctl enable tlp
sudo systemctl start tlp

# Edit config
sudo nano /etc/tlp.conf
```

Find and set these lines:
```
START_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=55
STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=60
Save (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter) and apply:

bash
sudo tlp start
Method 2: Direct sysfs (Immediate)

bash
# Set stop threshold at 60%
echo 60 | sudo tee /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold

# Set start threshold at 55% (optional)
echo 55 | sudo tee /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_start_threshold
Verify it's working:

bash
cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold
Should show: 60

üîí Make It Permanent
Create a systemd service to set on every boot:

bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/battery-threshold.service
```

Paste this:
```
[Unit]
Description=Set Battery Charge Threshold
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'echo 60 > /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold'
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'echo 55 > /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_start_threshold'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Enable it:

bash
sudo systemctl enable battery-threshold.service
sudo systemctl start battery-threshold.service
üìä The 60% Rule
When to use 60%:

‚úÖ Laptop plugged in at desk 90%+ of the time
‚úÖ You have AC power nearby always
‚úÖ You want maximum battery lifespan (3-5+ years)
When NOT to use 60%:

‚ùå You're mobile/traveling frequently (use 80% instead)
‚ùå You need longer unplugged runtime
üí° Pro Tips for 60% Life
Check current charge before enabling:
bash
   cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity
If it's above 60%, it won't discharge automatically - just use it unplugged until it hits 60%

Monthly calibration:
Once a month, disable the threshold
Let battery discharge to 10-15%
Charge to 100%
Re-enable 60% limit
This keeps the battery gauge accurate
Monitor battery health:
bash
   tlp-stat -b
Check for cycle count and wear level

üéØ Bottom Line
60% = Maximum longevity. If you're plugged in most of the time, this is objectively the best setting. Your battery will thank you in 3-4 years when others are replacing theirs and yours is still healthy.

Want me to help you set up the automatic calibration reminder too?

üìä What These Settings Do
Why powersave governor with intel_pstate?

With intel_pstate, powersave is NOT actually "slow mode"
It uses hardware P-states and dynamically adjusts frequency
Combined with EPP, it's the most efficient option
Energy Performance Preference (EPP):

balance_performance (AC) = Good performance, reasonable power
power (BAT) = Maximum battery life
CPU_MAX_PERF_ON_BAT=30:

Limits battery CPU to 30% of max performance
Your CPU goes from 2.4GHz max to ~800MHz (as shown in your output)
Massive battery savings
Turbo Boost:

Currently disabled (no_turbo = 1)
Enable on AC for performance boost (2.4GHz ‚Üí 3.0GHz)
Keep disabled on battery
‚ö° Current Issues I See
Max frequency capped at 800MHz: This is because max_perf_pct = 100 but something is limiting it
Turbo is disabled: no_turbo = 1
Your CPU should reach 2.4GHz base and 3.0GHz turbo, but it's stuck at 800MHz.

üîç Check What's Limiting Your CPU
bash
# Check current frequency
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep MHz

# Check throttling
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq

# Check if thermald is throttling
sudo systemctl status thermald
üéØ Recommended Performance Profiles
Balanced (recommended for you):

bash
CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC=balance_performance
CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_BAT=power
CPU_MAX_PERF_ON_AC=100
CPU_MAX_PERF_ON_BAT=30
CPU_BOOST_ON_AC=1
CPU_BOOST_ON_BAT=0
Maximum Battery Life:

bash
CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC=balance_power
CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_BAT=power
CPU_MAX_PERF_ON_AC=80
CPU_MAX_PERF_ON_BAT=20
CPU_BOOST_ON_AC=0
CPU_BOOST_ON_BAT=0
Maximum Performance (when plugged in):

bash
CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC=performance
CPU_MAX_PERF_ON_AC=100
CPU_BOOST_ON_AC=1
üí° Quick Verification After Setup
bash
# Should show balance_performance on AC
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference

# Should show 0 (turbo enabled) when on AC
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo

# Should show higher than 800MHz when on AC
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
Apply these settings and let me know if your CPU frequencies look better! The 800MHz cap seems unusual for AC power.

PERFECT! üéâ Your TLP is now optimally configured! Look at these improvements:

‚úÖ What Changed (HUGE improvements!)
Before:

scaling_max_freq = 800000 [kHz] (800 MHz - crippled!)
no_turbo = 1 (turbo disabled)
hwp_dynamic_boost = 0 (dynamic boost off)
After:

scaling_max_freq = 3000000 [kHz] (3.0 GHz - FULL TURBO!)
no_turbo = 0 (turbo enabled ‚úì)
hwp_dynamic_boost = 1 (dynamic boost enabled ‚úì)
energy_performance_preference = balance_performance ‚úì
nmi_watchdog = 0 (power saving enabled) ‚úì
üöÄ What This Means
Your CPU can now:

Base frequency: 400 MHz - 2.4 GHz
Turbo boost: Up to 3.0 GHz when needed
Dynamic boost: Responds faster to workload changes
Smart scaling: Balances performance and efficiency
üîã Battery Threshold Check
bash
cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold
Should show 60. If it does, you're all set!

üìä Performance Modes Active
Currently (AC mode):

Max frequency: 3.0 GHz ‚úì
Turbo: Enabled ‚úì
EPP: balance_performance ‚úì
When on battery:

Max performance: 30% (saves battery)
Turbo: Disabled (saves battery)
EPP: power (maximum efficiency)
üéØ You're Now Running the OPTIMAL Setup
60% charge limit = Maximum battery longevity
Full performance on AC = No compromises when plugged in
Aggressive power saving on battery = Extended runtime
Intel dynamic boost = Snappy response to workload
Your Lenovo is now configured like a pro! The difference should be very noticeable - faster performance on AC, longer battery life unplugged, and your battery will last years longer than default settings.

Want to test the CPU performance? Run:

bash
watch -n 1 'grep MHz /proc/cpuinfo'
You should see frequencies jumping up to 2400-3000 MHz under load now! üî•
