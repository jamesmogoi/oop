# Tiny Habits Review

Last week we spent time learning about the **[Science Behind Self Improvement](https://savanna.alxafrica.com/concepts/107711)** and the importance of building tiny habits. Dr. BJ Fogg’s TEDx talk _“Forget Big Change, Start with a Tiny Habit”_ was mind-blowing for so many of you. As you may recall, it touched on:

- The importance of celebrating small victories.
- The impact of our environment.
- How to build new habits one small step at a time.
- The role that motivation plays.

We also talked about forging tiny habits and how to use Fogg’s format to articulate your action plan. Do you remember how the powerful declaration goes?

“After I………(existing habit), I will………(new habit)“

Yes, that’s it! We knew you knew that! Can you share one of these completed statements with your squad right now? Here is an example of a completed statement: _After I **make my morning coffee** I will **do my Morning Pages**._

Now that your memory has been refreshed, I bet you’re eager to learn how we can create habits that last! Do you know how you can use the word ==“after”== to help create a habit?

Click the **[link to watch this 2-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxngufGsdzg)** to learn more about using the word “after”. As you watch, think about the following questions:

- How can you use the word “after” to form a habit-related statement?
- How does “after” help you create a new habit?
- What activity do I already do reliably (for example, wake up, take a shower, or eat dinner)?
- How can I use these reliable habits as pegs (marking points) to build new beneficial habits? For example, **after** eating dinner, **I will** complete one module of my Professional Foundations work.

Climate change is a trending global concern that calls for an immediate solution within the next couple of years.

As stated in this **[United Nations article](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change)**, Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

The main greenhouse gases that cause climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from many sources including:

- gasoline for driving a car
- coal for heating a building
- Clearing land and cutting down forest
- Agriculture, oil and gas operations

Read **[the full article](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change)** to understand climate change, its main contributors and the vast solutions already being implemented.# Global Challenge: Tech x Climate Change

A tech startup **[Sylvera](https://www.sylvera.com/)** approaches carbon reduction within the industry and supply chain based on the combination of its SaaS (Software as a Service) digital platform and API (Application Programming Interface), which serve as a data verifier to help the carbon offset market scale.

More specifically, Sylvera works with offset projects to increase their validity by running geospatial data, machine learning, and climate data through their algorithms to create a standardized rating for a specific carbon offset project.

Okay, this might sound conflicting, right? Since agriculture is notorious for being one of the highest emitters of greenhouse gasses, does it mean we must stop farming? **No!** It means there is a HUGE opportunity to implement sustainable agricultural ways that support our climate and its inhabitants.

The World Bank is seizing the opportunity to implement ==Climate-Smart Agriculture== (CSA) in countries across the globe.

What is Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA)?  
Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an integrated approach to managing landscapes; cropland, livestock, forests and fisheries.

Climate-Smart Agriculture addresses the interlinked challenges of food security and accelerating climate change. CSA aims to simultaneously achieve three outcomes.

1. ==Increased productivity:== Produce more and better food to improve nutrition security and boost incomes, especially for 75% of the world’s poor population, who live in rural areas and mainly rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.
2. ==Enhanced resilience:== Reduce vulnerability to drought, pests, diseases and other climate-related risks and shocks; and improve capacity to adapt and grow in the face of longer-term stresses like shortened seasons and erratic weather patterns.
3. ==Reduced emissions:== Pursue lower emissions for each calorie or kilo of food produced, avoid deforestation from agriculture and identify ways to absorb carbon from the atmosphere.

The first 2 points speak to opportunities in Agriculture, while the 3rd point addresses Agriculture’s impact on Climate Change.

# Global Opportunity: Tech x Agriculture

#### And yes, you guessed it! Tech is at the forefront of implementing CSA.

What previously was not possible due to the lack of data and visibility is becoming possible today thanks to a range of technologies that make monitoring agricultural practices and measuring their environmental outcomes possible on a global scale. These technologies are fascinating and key to enabling the next generation of climate-smart agriculture.

So what are these new technologies that enable leading agricultural producers and food manufacturers to gain visibility into the state and the impact of global food production? These include satellite imagery, big data and impact models (that are used as crop and soil simulators run in the cloud).

In addition to solving Climate Change, CSA is also inadvertently solving two other Global Challenges: Job Creation and Health Care.

- Job creation through income generation for 75% of the world’s poor communities.
- Healthcare through improved nutritional security.

One good deed does go a long way.

#### Honorable Mention:

==Blue River Technology== is an AI-powered platform that uses computer vision to identify and spray weeds in crops without harming the actual crops. This will undoubtedly help the world immensely with food production, and reduce the harmful effects of chemical use in agriculture over the next century. You can get a glimpse of their work in this video.

Covid disrupted the world’s approach to healthcare and forced the community to take Health trends more seriously. According to the World Economic Forum, there are 8 Health trends to watch for in 2023, one of which is mental health and well-being. Take a moment to read **[the full article](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/04/world-health-day-healthcare-trends)** to understand each trend.

It is encouraging to note that world leaders have healthcare on their main agenda and key discussions are focused on Covid-19, Mental Health, Tuberculosis and the impact of climate change on children’s health. Key corporates like Deloitte have health equity as a priority. Finally, the global healthcare outlook predicts digital transformation will revolutionize the healthcare sector.

#### Companies Applying Technology to Solve Healthcare Challenges:

As we have learned in the resource above, healthcare challenges have always plagued countries across the globe. Africa is no exception. There has been an explosion in healthcare startups and companies trying to solve problems in the space. One of these companies is **Daktari Online** whose platform connects patients with licensed healthcare providers who can diagnose and treat a range of health conditions via video chat, helping to improve access to healthcare services in Kenya.

What other companies do you know of that are helping solve challenges in the healthcare industry?
## Introduction

0:00

Transcriber: Gisele Cristina Ribeiro Reviewer: lisa thompson

0:10

Artificial intelligence has often been depicted as villain robots

0:14

ready to take over the world.

0:16

But I’m here to tell you that AI can actually save lives

0:20

and improve health care for millions of patients around the world.

0:25

AI is helping us personalize the delivery of care,

0:29

make hospitals more efficient,

0:31

and improve access to health care by providing accurate decision-making tools.

## What is AI

0:37

AI is the process of educating a computer model

0:40

using complex and large data sets.

0:43

The model learns from this data in a training process

0:46

to build its ability to make decisions

0:49

or predict outcomes when presented with new data.

0:54

We are talking about having access to a computer model that knows,

0:57

based on the experience of thousands of other patients,

1:01

whether a treatment is likely to work

1:03

and what works best for that patient based on their individual conditions.

1:09

No two of you in this room or, in fact, anywhere in the world are alike.

1:14

But AI models are helping our doctors

1:17

learn from patients with similar conditions

1:19

or even similar genetic information

1:21

and make highly informed decisions

1:23

about their diagnosis and their treatment options.

1:27

I want to talk about how we are starting to use AI

1:30

for delivering care to cancer patients.

1:34

Cancer diagnosis can be immensely complicated,

1:37

both for the doctors

1:38

in making decisions about diagnosing a primary or secondary cancer,

1:42

as well as for the patients, in understanding the risks

1:45

and success rates of the treatment options.

1:49

But we are developing AI models that can help streamline this process

1:54

by taking information from a number of sources.

## AI for cancer diagnosis

1:58

This involves feeding an AI model data from the patient’s blood tests,

2:03

X-ray images of the suspected lesions,

2:06

as well as genetic information from a tissue biopsy.

2:10

The trained AI model can rapidly consolidate this information

2:14

and provide highly accurate predictions of the patient's diagnosis,

2:19

treatment options most likely to succeed, as well as the prognosis.

2:25

Let’s talk about Peter, who is a cancer patient.

2:29

He’s gone through comprehensive clinical assessment, imaging

2:33

and various other diagnostic workups,

2:35

but not even the best doctors in town can tell him where his cancer primary site is,

2:43

meaning he can’t get a treatment specific for his cancer

2:47

and his chances of surviving another five years is less than ten percent.

## AI for prediction

2:52

But our team right here in Brisbane

2:55

has developed a tool using AI and patients’ genetic information

2:59

that can accurately identify the cancer primary site of Peter,

3:03

and empower doctors

3:05

to give Peter a treatment that we know is going to work for him.

3:09

These type of models can be expanded exponentially

3:14

to predict accurate health care.

3:17

This means using an AI model

3:20

to understand whether a certain population is more susceptible to a certain disease

3:26

and whether they would respond more favorably

3:28

to certain health care interventions.

3:32

AI is giving us the ability to have a much more refined

3:35

and detailed understanding of human health than we’ve ever had before.

3:41

But there is a catch to the immense promise of AI

3:44

being implemented into routine clinical practice.

3:48

Our existing regulation frameworks aren’t designed for AI software

3:53

intended for diagnosing, treating or managing the disease,

3:57

also known as AI-based software as a medical device.

4:01

They are designed for physical medical devices, like surgical implants,

4:05

or most software that have the same output

4:08

every time that the patient or clinicians are using them.

4:13

Traditional software are static,

4:15

in a sense that the developers release a version of a software

4:19

and, no matter how many times you use it,

4:21

it would always have the same output for the same data.

4:25

On the other hand,

4:26

AI software behaves completely differently to most software in health care

4:30

because of the intrinsic ability to learn and evolve over time,

4:34

ideally becoming more intelligent

4:36

as suited to the environment that they’re being used at.

4:39

Our existing regulation frameworks

4:41

rely on the static and reproducible nature of this software

4:45

to prove that they are safe

4:46

to be implemented into routine clinical practice.

4:51

So, our regulatory authorities’ solution has been to lock the learning potential

4:55

of these algorithms before they are implemented into clinical practice.

5:00

This means that the model can no longer learn from its environment and new data,

5:05

which limits its potential to improve its functionality or its accuracy,

5:09

you know, the whole point of AI.

5:12

And, at times, this can even be harmful for the patients

5:15

because the AI model is no longer trained on the most up-to-date data

5:20

and can potentially lead to a wrong diagnosis.

## Regulation

5:25

But the good news is

5:27

that there are emerging regulation frameworks being proposed

5:30

that, if implemented right, can be a game changer.

5:35

Our regulatory authorities are proposing using more transparent reporting mechanism

5:40

so that the developers can disclose how their models would learn

5:44

and evolve over time.

5:45

And this will be combined with ongoing and real-time monitoring

5:49

to make sure that the predicted changes actually occur

5:52

and that the software is adaptive to make much more accurate predictions

5:57

and improve health care outcomes.

5:59

We also need to make sure

6:01

that the training data used for these algorithms

6:04

are representative of the entire human population.

6:08

Let’s look at a mobile-based diagnostic software

6:11

that we are developing right here in Brisbane

6:14

that uses AI to detect skin cancer

6:17

from the images that you’ve taken on your iPhone.

6:21

If this model has been trained on a predominantly Caucasian population,

6:25

how well do you think it would do

6:27

on an African American or an Asian patient?

6:31

Our AI developers have a huge responsibility

6:34

to make sure that data bias doesn’t exist

6:37

and that their models are trained

6:39

on diverse and robust data sets, representative of the entire population,

6:44

you know, not just white males.

6:48

But at times, we understand that this is not entirely possible.

6:52

Skin cancer does, in fact,

6:54

disproportionately affect the Caucasian population

6:57

because of the genetic differences,

6:59

and, as a result, there are much larger data sets available for those patients.

7:05

But this means that we need to build in a functionality in our AI models

7:09

that, for low confidence results, for an Asian patient, for example,

7:14

the model is capable of saying “I don’t know”

7:17

or that “This is my best guess based on a skewed training population.”

7:22

But, unfortunately, this functionality doesn’t exist yet,

7:25

and it’s urgently needed to be mandated by our regulators.

## Conclusion

7:31

To successfully implement AI in health care,

7:34

we need to establish new regulatory frameworks

7:38

in consultation with AI developers, health care practitioners,

7:42

policy advisers,

7:44

as well as the patients themselves, to bring the best out of AI.

7:50

Improve the regulatory frameworks

7:51

can make sure that diverse and robust tools are developed

7:56

that are compliant and adaptive

7:58

and can serve the whole population equally.

8:01

If we get this right, we can transform the delivery of health care

8:06

where we are promoting personalized health and well-being advice.

8:09

I’m excited to be at the forefront of translating this amazing technology

8:15

into health care

8:16

and use this to help millions of lives around the world.

8:21

(Applause)

Wildlife refers to all non-domesticated plants, animals, and other organisms living in their natural habitats. This includes a variety of creatures, from large mammals like lions and elephants to tiny insects like bees and butterflies. Wildlife is an important part of our natural world and plays a critical role in maintaining ecosystems and biodiversity. However, many wildlife species are threatened by habitat loss, climate change, and other human activities, making conservation efforts important to protect these creatures and their habitats. The International Institute of Sustainable Development (IISD) reports that:

#### More than 40,000 species are threatened with extinction.

That means the next generation might never get to see some species. As the world becomes warmer the rate of extinction of species accelerates. Why is this a problem? The destruction of the natural world is causing various negative impacts on human health including;

- Increased exposure to disease
- Worsened air and water quality
- Decreased food production
- Deepened impact of extreme weather events
- Weakened ability to combat climate change
- Decreased well-being

One company doing amazing work is Earth Ranger which uses Artificial Intelligence and the Global Positioning System (GPS) to monitor wildlife movements and potentially prevent human-wildlife conflict by mobilizing support to get animals back within their geofences. See this amazing video on how the company is doing this. As you watch the video, ask yourself the following questions:

1. How does EarthRanger work to protect wildlife?
2. What are the key technological innovations that allow EarthRanger to be successful?
3. What other technology can promote wildlife protection?

## Intro

0:01

at no other time in human history have

0:04

we altered our planet's landscape so

0:07

dramatically

0:08

with just less than a quarter of all

0:11

land and oceans protected

0:13

wildlife are under constant threat

0:17

threats of habitat destruction from

0:19

agriculture

0:20

mining logging and new human settlements

0:25

from human-caused climate change

0:27

destabilizing the whole planet

0:30

and from poachers and the entire illegal

0:33

wildlife trade

## Overview

0:37

on this path time is running out a third

0:40

of all wildlife are headed toward

0:43

extinction

0:44

but for most of them extinction is not

0:47

inevitable

## The RealTime Tool

0:48

earth ranger is giving those fighting

0:51

for the future of our wildlife the real

0:53

time tool they need to stay a step ahead

0:57

the software gives protected area

0:59

managers ecologists and biologists the

1:02

bird's eye view they need to keep

1:04

wildlife habitats and communities safe

1:08

to study what you cannot easily see

1:10

opens new insights

1:12

by using gps cameras and other devices

1:16

connected to the platform researchers

1:18

can monitor and track wildlife movements

1:21

to identify important wildlife corridors

1:25

scientists are expanding our

1:27

understanding of ecosystems and with the

1:29

ability to see and mobilize all

1:32

resources at hand the software is even

1:34

helping to enhance disaster responses

1:38

with instant alerts protected area

1:41

managers have the tools to react swiftly

1:44

to situations like geofence breaches

1:46

that could lead to potential human

1:49

wildlife conflict

1:51

and be able to mobilize resources to

1:53

move animals out of harm's way

1:58

using historical data patrols can be

2:01

deployed much more efficiently to

2:03

poaching hotspots

2:05

drastically reducing the killing of

2:07

endangered wildlife

## Outro

2:16

actionable real-time information is the

2:19

key to saving our wildlife and precious

2:22

landscapes

2:24

earth ranger is now in over 40 countries

2:28

helping protect wildlife and habitats

2:30

around the clock

2:33

through widespread partnerships and

2:35

putting the power of data in the hands

2:37

of people earth ranger is helping

2:39

restore trust and security throughout

2:42

communities around the world

2:45

and by securing the future for wildlife

2:48

we are securing the future for ourselves

One brilliant solution presented by a young conservationist from Zimbabwe is to get local communities involved in conservation efforts. Take a look. As you watch the video, ask yourself the following questions:

1. Why does the speaker say that it is important for communities to be involved in wildlife conservation?
2. What methods are recommended to increase local community involvement in conservation?

Reflect:  

- What endangered species are found in your home country?
- Why are they endangered?
- What are your thoughts on the local community getting involved with conserving endangered wildlife within the local areas? What are the pros and cons?

Share your thoughts with your **[squad on eHub.](https://ehub.alxafrica.com)**


## ranscript

0:13

I'm a lion conservationist.

0:15

Sounds cool, doesn't it?

0:17

Some people may have no idea what that means.

0:20

But I'm sure you've all heard about Cecil the lion.

0:23

[Cecil the Lion (2002-2015)]

0:25

(Lion roaring)

0:31

He roars no more.

0:34

On the second of July, 2015,

0:36

his life was cut short when he was killed by a trophy hunter.

0:41

They say that you can become attached to the animals you study.

0:44

That was the case for me with Cecil the lion,

0:47

having known him and studied him for three years

0:49

in Hwange National Park.

0:52

I was heartbroken at his death.

0:56

But the good thing to come out of this tragedy

0:58

is the attention that the story brought

1:00

towards the plight of threatened wild animals.

1:04

After Cecil's death,

1:06

I began to ask myself these questions:

1:09

What if the community that lived next to Cecil the lion

1:13

was involved in protecting him?

1:15

What if I had met Cecil when I was 10 years old, instead of 29?

1:21

Could I or my classmates have changed his fate?

1:25

Many people are working to stop lions from disappearing,

1:28

but very few of these people are native to these countries

1:32

or from the communities most affected.

1:35

But the communities that live with the lions

1:38

are the ones best positioned to help lions the most.

1:42

Local people should be at the forefront

1:44

of the solutions to the challenges facing their wildlife.

1:48

Sometimes, change can only come

1:50

when the people most affected and impacted take charge.

1:54

Local communities play an important role

1:56

in fighting poaching and illegal wildlife trade,

1:59

which are major threats affecting lions and other wildlife.

2:04

Being a black African woman in the sciences,

2:07

the people I meet are always curious to know

2:09

if I've always wanted to be a conservationist,

2:12

because they don't meet a lot of conservationists

2:14

who look like me.

2:16

When I was growing up,

2:17

I didn't even know that wildlife conservation was a career.

2:20

The first time I saw a wild animal in my home country

2:24

was when I was 25 years old,

2:26

even though lions and African wild dogs

2:29

lived just a few miles away from my home.

2:32

This is quite common in Zimbabwe,

2:35

as many people are not exposed to wildlife,

2:37

even though it's part of our heritage.

2:40

When I was growing up,

2:42

I didn't even know that lions lived in my backyard.

2:46

When I stepped into Savé Valley Conservancy

2:48

on a cold winter morning 10 years ago

2:51

to study African wild dogs for my master's research project,

2:56

I was mesmerized by the beauty and the tranquility that surrounded me.

3:00

I felt like I had found my passion and my purpose in life.

3:04

I made a commitment that day

3:06

that I was going to dedicate my life to protecting animals.

3:09

I think of my childhood school days in Zimbabwe

3:12

and the other kids I was in school with.

3:15

Perhaps if we had a chance to interact with wildlife,

3:19

more of my classmates would be working alongside me now.

3:23

Unless the local communities want to protect and coexist with wildlife,

3:28

all conservation efforts might be in vain.

3:31

These are the communities that live with the wild animals

3:34

in the same ecosystem

3:36

and bear the cost of doing so.

3:39

If they don't have a direct connection

3:41

or benefit from the animals,

3:43

they have no reason to want to protect them.

3:46

And if local communities don't protect their wildlife,

3:49

no amount of outside intervention will work.

3:53

So what needs to be done?

3:56

Conservationists must prioritize environmental education

4:00

and help expand the community's skills to conserve their wildlife.

4:04

Schoolchildren and communities must be taken to national parks,

4:08

so they get a chance to connect with the wildlife.

4:11

At every effort and every level,

4:14

conservation must include the economies of the people

4:17

who share the land with the wild animals.

4:20

It is also critical that local conservationists

4:24

be part of every conservation effort,

4:27

if we are to build trust and really embed conservation into communities.

4:31

As local conservationists, we face many hurdles,

4:35

from outright discrimination to barriers because of cultural norms.

4:40

But I will not give up my efforts

4:42

to bring indigenous communities to this fight

4:45

for the survival of our planet.

4:47

I'm asking you to come and stand together with me.

4:50

We must actively dismantle the hurdles we have created,

4:54

which are leaving indigenous populations out of conservation efforts.

4:58

I've dedicated my life to protecting lions.

5:01

And I know my neighbor would, too,

5:03

if only they knew the animals that lived next door to them.

5:08

Thank you.

5:10

obviously there was a sense of

0:16

understanding in terms of how human and

0:20

what life are all interlinked

0:25

but it came to the point where I became

0:28

curious to become advocates of what life

0:33

my name is Mohammed onc I work as a

0:46

Community Partnership project manager

0:49

for Singita service and Conservation

1:00

have many untapped opportunities and her

1:04

of our job is to also look at what is it

1:06

that communities can benefit from

1:07

conservation and we're looking at what

1:10

is it that tourism businesses can source

1:13

from the local communities

1:18

[Music]

1:21

we never had an MBA that looks at

1:26

conservation Africa can do more with its

1:30

own conservation and untapped natural

1:32

1:34

[Music]

1:43

Lu was established to address what we

1:46

believe this Africa's greatest challenge

1:47

which is the lack of good leadership a

1:49

mission with the school while life

1:51

conservation is to increase the supply

1:53

of capable African leaders who can bring

1:55

the best management leadership and

1:58

business practices to conservation

2:03

if we don't protect what we have who

2:06

might lose it over time we can have

2:09

means to ensure that conservation and

2:13

people better understand each other and

2:15

live in peace and harmony we have two

2:18

African eyes the wireless sector so we

2:20

have to have African producers and

2:22

African consumers it's not enough to do

2:26

conservation for conservation zinc

2:27

protecting wildlife is actually the

2:29

interests of people as well we really

2:30

think it's important to look at the

2:31

wildlife economy and to see it as one of

2:33

Africa's greatest assets it's not for

2:37

foreign countries to come and show

2:39

Africa what it has but it is for us to

2:41

show the world what we have it is

2:45

actually trying to address African

2:48

challenges within the pan-african

2:50

mindset it begins to look at

2:53

conservation as something which has the

2:55

potential to become the biggest business

2:58

in the world

2:59

we're not protectors we are builders of

3:01

natural capital I think Fred has a very

3:05

good vision of part of the degree being

3:08

action and I think we need to move

3:11

African education in that direction

into your Vitra your value and your

3:29

vision to see successful conservation

3:32

areas and successful communities loving

3:43

while that doesn't conserve water we

3:45

have to be competent authority

3:48

conservation can be a pillar for

3:50

economic development in Africa and you

3:51

don't want to deplete it you want to

3:53

invest in it you want to make it grow

3:54

larger because of benefit generations to

3:56

come

3:57

what I'd love to see in the next five

4:00

years is see communities transform to

4:03

more sustainable with practices it has

4:07

to be inclusive to benefit everyone in a

4:10

more ethical way we're going to create

4:13

an abundance of Wildlife

4:15

while also creating opportunities for

4:17

people we need to go out and do what we

4:19

can to really transform Africa before

4:21
