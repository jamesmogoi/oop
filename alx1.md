### Welcome to Week 4, Learners!

This is the final week in “Phase 1” of this course!

If you’re feeling what we felt after Week 3, you’ll know we’re right in the nitty-gritty and meaty part of the learning journey!

### Last week

You donned your Sherlock Holmes cap and mastered the art of problem definition, problem-solving approaches, and asking the right questions for gathering information.

### This week

We’ll pick up right where we left off. You put in some serious effort and hard work last week, and now it’s time to harness and transform it all into a compelling story. This week we will provide you with the tools and techniques to conduct research and use your findings to craft a narrative—and presentation—that captivates and leaves a lasting impact on your audience. This week will take your storytelling skills to the next level! Remember, there is another milestone to submit this week, and we will give you sneak peak into what is in it in the next few pages.

To give you a sneak peek of what’s in store, we have provided a video that offers an overview of the week ahead. While watching it, pay close attention to the following key points:

- Milestone and Weekly Test Reminders
- Week 4 learning focus (building upon the foundations laid in Week 3)
- The 2 peer activities
- Guidelines for **Week 4 Milestone**
- Submission deadline for both **Week 4 Milestone** and **Week 4 Test**
Professional Foundations - Week 4 Overview
Video Transcript

Hi everyone, it’s me, your facilitator, Muhammad Khisal! Welcome to Week 4. The days are really cruising by, and it’s officially almost the end of Phase 1! A big congratulations to you for successfully completing all the work in Week 3! You really are making great progress!

We know that Week 3 was very full and may have tested your limits, but we are confident in what you can achieve. The ALX Professional Foundations team believes we “Do Hard Things” and refuses to settle for the ordinary. So, well done for tackling Week 3 and building the habits and skills that will set you up for success for a long time to come. You are making a huge investment in yourself, and we take our hats off to you for staying committed to your growth. 

Last week, we challenged you to incorporate Morning Pages into your daily routine. If you had a mic drop moment and successfully completed the challenge to practice Morning Pages every day for 7 days straight, you earned your bragging rights. We celebrate you and give you full permission to flex a little in your squads on the eHub.  

If you did not complete the challenge, or maybe just managed to write on some days, we encourage you to reflect on the reasons for not being able to complete the challenge and whether there is something you can do differently to incorporate Morning Pages into your everyday routine this week. The benefits of practicing Morning Pages really speak for themselves, and we want everyone to experience them.

Before we discuss Week 4, I have a few important requests and reminders. If you have any milestones or tests that you have not submitted or passed, please do so as soon as possible. Remember! To pass the course, you must:
Pass all Weekly Tests with a minimum score of 70%.
Submit all Weekly Milestones on time.
Complete and pass all End of Module Quizzes.
If you are behind with any of these, please catch up before the end of Phase 1. In this way you will ensure that you can easily keep up and continue your journey with us.

OK, we’re really excited about this week! Let’s dive into where your learning experience will take you in Week 4. Last week, you spent time learning how to define and scope a problem, and you engaged with 2 problem-solving approaches: The McKinsey Method and the Cool Head, Warm Heart Method. You practiced asking the right questions and developed 3 research questions and a hypothesis.

This week, you will continue the hard work you did in Week 3 by deepening the skills you need to define the scope of the problem further, tell compelling stories, and create the perfect slide deck.

This week you will:
Continue to incorporate healthy habits into your routine and start practicing the last tool in the Daily 3, which is Meditation.
Practice using AI tools for web research and draft a mini-research report.
Review problem definition, and refine your own problem definition from Week 3.
Strengthen your communication skills with some writing foundations, including storytelling and technical writing.
Boost your storytelling abilities.
Learn how to communicate better with tech teams.
Get organized with work-planning practices, techniques, and tools.
Get a glimpse of the opportunities that exist due to technology. 
Explore the impact of AI.

You’ll also have 2 content-related activities this week:
For the first activity, you will write a 400-500 word story and find at least 2 peers with whom to have fun storytelling. You can carry out this activity with your peers online or at your City Hub if you are close to one. The storytelling activity will require at least one hour of your time. 
The second peer activity will focus on your completed work plan. This is an essential element of your learning journey as you prepare for Phase 2’s lessons and your team project. Again, you will need to collaborate with at least 2 peers and set aside 1 hour to complete this activity online or at your nearest City Hub. 

This week's learning content on Savanna provides more information on both of these activities. Please make sure that you give yourself enough time to do the work with your peers. 

The Week 4 Milestone and Week 4 Test are due by the end of this week. The Week 4 Test is an automatically graded quiz that you will take here on Savanna. The list of topics covered in this test appears in the next few pages.

The Week 4 Milestone is a completed Milestone Worksheet .pdf submission. You will fill out the Milestone Worksheet using the information from the Google slide deck you created as part of the assessment. Your slide deck will be a cumulation of the work you complete throughout the week, namely:
Your chosen GCGO and why it matters.
A clearly defined problem based on a GCGO.
Its impact on a specific target audience (#UserPersonas).
Components of your problem-solving framework.
Your solution and action steps. 
References and citations.

We have provided clear step-by-step instructions on the Week 4 Milestone pages.  

We hope that you’ll find this week to be engaging and rewarding. As a master of your own learning journey, think ahead and allocate your time, energy, and focus accordingly. There is a lot of content to cover and new skills to acquire, so start early and work at it every day.

To grow, one has to push limits. We are confident in your ability to tackle this week like the young leader you are. We know you did not come here expecting the ordinary. So buckle up, dig deep for that energy, and let’s do this! 

All the best with Week 4!


# Daily 3: Meditation

This week you will be adding the 3rd habit of the Daily 3 to your habits: Meditation!

**Mindfulness meditation** is simply the practice of relaxing the body and focusing one’s attention (on your breath or an object of your choice) to gain greater awareness of one’s thoughts and feelings.

So why should you meditate? This short 2-minute video offers several reasons. As you’re watching, ask yourself:

During Week 1, we discussed the powerful benefits of meditation. It can help with reducing negativity, stress, and anxiety, while also boosting positivity, focus, concentration, and overall well-being. Studies have shown its effectiveness.

Learning to meditate is like learning any other new skill. If you’re just starting, it will likely feel like exercising a muscle that you’ve never really worked out before. It will take consistent practice to get comfortable. So be patient with yourself and give yourself the opportunity to try it multiple times.

  

This week, we will explore the basics of meditation and guide you through a simple practice to help you get started. Whether you’re new to meditation or have been practicing for years, **we challenge you to 7 days of daily 5-minute meditation practice.** We invite you to notice what effect it has on you!

You might be thinking “I don’t have the time for this.” Well, did you know that **even 1 minute of mindfulness meditation has measurable benefits?** Numerous studies and testimonials demonstrate the marked benefits of meditation and mindfulness practices. We will share one such testimonial in the next few pages.

We hope you will develop a new habit with this ancient practice and enjoy its many benefits.

Read the following supplementary article to learn more about how meditation can benefit your wellbeing as well as performance in professional and academic tasks.

Take a moment to reflect on your ==Daily 3 activities.== How have they helped you stay focused and productive throughout the weeks? Share your reflections with your peers and inspire others to stick to their Daily 3 goals.
# Meditation: Challenge

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T094536Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=9b1e2784b368d9d1059ca010d9c3cd843a196c3067051379688d0ad786df9f5a)

  
**Our challenge for you this week is to incorporate Meditation into your daily routine.**

This is in addition to your Daily 3 practices of Movement and Morning Pages. The three habits have immense benefits, so it is important to build and stick to each one.

**So, for your challenge this week, here is what you need to do:**

- Follow **[this link](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=shot+medidation+for+college+students)** to a list of 5-minute meditation videos for students or you can download a meditation app on your phone. Our favourite apps are:
    - **[Waking Up](https://www.wakingup.com/tim)**
    - **[Calm](https://www.calm.com/)**
    - **[Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app)**
- Pick a meditation that speaks to you so you can use it this week. We recommend picking one and sticking to it a few times. That way you build familiarity with it.
- Decide on a time you will meditate every day and stick to it.
- Get comfortable, play your chosen video and follow along.
- Do this for 7 days straight!

You can choose to meditate without the video-guided meditation, but if you are new at this, the videos are the perfect companion to help along. Here is one short video that we like from the list above. You are welcome to follow along.

At the beginning of Month 2, we will ask you to honestly share one or two things that changed in your day-to-day life from practising meditation. We are curious people and want to know if taking a few moments each day to be mindful added any benefits.

## ranscript

- [Narrator] Hey there, and thanks

0:01

for gifting yourself these next few minutes.

0:04

It's important to remember that you're a priority,

0:07

and allowing yourself even just a few short minutes

0:09

of intentional reflection can really have

0:11

a positive impact on the rest of your day.

0:15

So let's use these next few minutes to come back to center

0:19

and set an intention for the rest of your day.

0:24

Move into a comfortable position,

0:26

whether you're seated at your desk at work

0:29

or laying on the couch at home, and gently close your eyes

0:33

and shift all of your attention

0:35

onto your breathing, taking slower, deeper breaths

0:40

than you've taken all day so far.

0:42

Taking a deep breath in through your nose

0:46

and slowly letting it out through your mouth.

0:52

And continuing to breathe that way,

0:54

feeling your lungs expand out as you inhale.

0:59

And contract back in as you exhale.

1:06

Tune into your body, noticing how it feels.

1:11

Noticing if there's anything that it's trying to tell you.

1:15

Notice any place of tension or tightness in your body

1:20

and give those areas permission to relax,

1:24

sending love into those areas.

1:28

Thank your body for taking such good care of you,

1:31

and let it know that it's okay to rest

1:33

and relax for these next few minutes.

1:42

You may notice that your mind starts to wander off.

1:45

That's okay.

1:46

That's natural.

1:49

Just notice it and bring your attention back to your body

1:52

using your breath as your anchor.

1:57

Try to picture one thing that's happened today

2:01

that's made you smile or made you thankful or appreciative

2:07

and just let that feeling fill you up for a moment.

2:11

Breathe that feeling in from the top of your head

2:13

to the tips of your toes

2:17

and allow yourself to smile, if that feels natural.

2:22

Now, focus on something that you can do today,

2:26

whether it's for yourself or for someone else

2:30

that will allow you to continue feeling this way.

2:34

It could be something as small

2:36

as deciding to go to bed early tonight

2:38

so that you have time to finally read that book

2:41

that's been on your bedside table.

2:44

Or the joy of getting dinner with a close friend.

2:48

What's one little thing you can plan for your day

2:50

to bring that intentional joy to it?

2:54

Now just focus on that for a few minutes.

2:58

Sit in that feeling of joy and peace.

3:02

(light music)

3:53

Now let's take a few more deep breaths together.

3:56

A deep breath in, feeling your lungs

3:59

expand out as you inhale,

4:02

and everything contract back in as you exhale.

4:09

Again, an even deeper breath than the one before it.

4:13

Holding that breath for a beat.

4:15

And exhaling everything out.

4:23

Last time, your deepest breath yet,

4:24

sending that breath through your entire body.

4:31

And exhale it out, and in your own time

4:34

slowly bring your awareness back to where you are

4:38

and thank yourself for taking these few minutes

4:40

to just be intentional and kind to yourself.

4:45

And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes

4:50

and enjoy the rest of your day.

4:52

(gentle piano music)

# king the Right Questions Review

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T095441Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=2e3c6d08c66f1a44ace9c308dd0d1f1632d61799be7481a4a94c2c19410ade44)

  

The other half of last week’s Milestone required you to formulate 3 research questions and a hypothesis. If you recall, we had a deep dive into the importance of asking effective questions that will inform your research. After all, problem-solving is all about asking the right questions.

==Do you remember how to check whether your questions are effective?==

Here is the recap: You can ask yourself more questions like:

- Does my question capture a complex issue or problem related to my chosen GCGO?
- Is my question nuanced, with no particular right or wrong answer or easy response?
- Is my question relevant to what is happening in the field?
- Do multiple stakeholders care about the answer to this question?
- Will I need to do more work to learn more about the factors affecting and influencing this question?

**Do you also remember the components of a good research question and the three different types of research questions?**

If you do, well done! Your work this week will revolve around research questions, so if you need a memory boost, take a moment now to refer back to the **[Research Questions](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/107824)** page from last week.

==Now, as a final step before we dive into all things research==

Take a moment to review your problem statement, 3 research questions, and hypotheses that you submitted as part of your Milestone 3 Worksheet. As you review, reflect on these two questions:

- What are the main things I’ve learned about the process of defining problems?
- From the top of my head, what are the most important key elements to ask effective questions?
# Research Methodology

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T095536Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=dfe07deb15c7a88dd340b2462b03a4b92c81772be0877c9892205c8f6f1d9d26)

  

Planning your research requires key steps that allow you to maximize your time and effort as much as possible. Below are some high-level steps to follow as you begin your research process:

1. ==Define your objectives, questions and hypotheses.== What are you trying to accomplish with this research? What do you wish to find out that will accelerate your work in the right direction?
2. ==Determine your end outputs.== What type of data/information is ideal for you to find, based on what you are trying to accomplish? Do you need to present it in any particular format?
3. ==Scope your main sources of information.== Do you already know where you might want to go to find the information you’re seeking? Are there particular entities or organizations that you know are seen as “experts” on the topic?
4. ==Begin gathering your required information.== What search terms should you use? How many reports/articles do you want to read before deciding you have seen enough?
5. ==Evaluate the validity/credibility of your sources and information.== From all of the information you’ve read or collected, which is most reliable? Are there any pieces of information that are validated across multiple sources? What about those that stand out / that are outliers? Which do you trust?
6. ==Synthesize and communicate your key findings.== What are the key takeaways that you want to share? How can you share them in such a way that provides the most impact?
7. ==Return to your original objectives and key questions== to ensure you have answered them appropriately. Have you found the answers you need or the direction you need to take?

---

Besides the above, it is also useful to remember that there will be times that you will _**NOT**_ have to go through an incredibly rigorous research process to find the answers you need. So, in addition to the steps above, it is also useful to determine whether any of the following approaches can help you instead:

- Discussions with internal experts: Is there anyone within your organization who might have the intel you’re seeking?
- Internal materials: Are there any existing materials in the organization that might provide a quick path to the answers you’re searching for?
- Government mandates: Are there any policies or regulations that dictate the right pathway to take?

So now let’s go back to the 3 research questions that you crafted as part of your Week 3 Milestone. It’s time to take these questions several steps further, do some research, and test each of your hypotheses.

==Here is what you need to do to complete this activity:==

1. Have your completed Milestone 3 worksheet open so you can easily reference your Problem Statement, research questions, and hypotheses.
2. We have created a worksheet that you can use to organize and plan your research. Open the **[research worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D34H8Nc_rOSmmk2gZNDgY16gmssMZtaQnL-wHCRc02A/copy)**, and create a personal copy.
3. You will go through the Research Methodology steps you have just learned, and assess how you plan to approach your web research for your 3 research questions from your completed Milestone 3 worksheet.
4. **Only complete Part 1** of the worksheet.

Later, you will complete Part 2 of the worksheet and use your findings to build a mini-research report.

_(We hope that you are saving all these resources we are sharing in a specific ALX Professional Foundations Program Folder on Drive. If you haven’t been doing so, now is a good time to stop and get organized. It will be super helpful when you have to review something later, whether in this program or your professional life.)_

1:53

by searching for the word discrimination

1:55

so i have a mac computer so i'm going to

1:57

press command

1:58

f if you have a windows computer you

2:01

press ctrl

2:11

the search bar appears i'm going to type

2:13

in the word

2:15

discrimination

2:17

and there's 12 instances of the word

2:21

discrimination

2:22

right one two three four five six seven

2:25

eight nine ten eleven twelve

2:27

so let's go okay the first ones here the

2:30

second one's here

2:31

third one's here let's see if there's

2:34

anything down here all right so

2:36

let's look at this sentence here it says

2:39

the indigenous

2:40

indian population continues to face

2:42

systematic discrimination

2:45

so indian population in mexico that's

2:47

interesting huh

2:49

okay um indigenous indians right so

2:52

native

2:53

mexicans just like we have native

2:55

americans

2:56

let's look for the next word

2:58

discrimination

3:01

okay here we go in addition indians

3:03

inability to speak spanish means that

3:06

they face

3:06

widespread employment discrimination in

3:09

spanish-speaking areas

3:11

in mexico okay 40 percent of the migrant

3:15

farm workers

3:16

are indian they have low income jobs

3:19

okay so that's another interesting fact

3:23

right um so let me copy this sentence

3:27

right

3:27

these are some good sentences i'm going

3:31

to

3:32

command c or i'm going to do this right

3:35

and go to my microsoft word okay

3:38

i'm going to make some spaces i'm going

3:39

to copy that sentence remember i'm not

3:42

putting this in my essay i'm not

3:43

plagiarizing this sentence i'm just

3:47

putting it here so i can see it later

3:49

right because i don't want to read

3:50

through the whole article

3:52

okay i'm going to continue to go through

3:54

okay

3:55

here's another one oh interesting

3:57

indigenous women suffer

3:59

many instances of double discrimination

4:01

the illiteracy rate

4:03

among women is 20 percent indigenous

4:05

women is 20

4:07

um so sexual assault and rape

4:10

and things like that so this paragraph

4:13

is about discrimination against women so

4:15

this

4:15

seems like a useful paragraph

4:19

for my research i'm going to copy it

4:21

into microsoft word

4:24

okay and let's just continue keep going

4:27

down here

4:28

all right and this is saying what the

4:32

government is

4:32

doing the government says that racial

4:35

discrimination does not exist in mexico

4:37

what so this

4:40

tells what the government is doing about

4:42

it and it sounds like they're not really

4:43

doing anything about it

4:45

so i'm going to paste that in because

4:47

that could be a nice

4:48

part of my paper what is the government

4:50

doing about discrimination in mexico

4:53

and what is the government in korea

4:54

doing about discrimination

4:56

in korea so remember i just took out a

4:59

few little tiny facts i didn't read the

5:01

whole article but maybe i should go back

5:03

and i should read there's probably some

5:04

other useful information here

5:08

56 ethnic and indigenous groups in

5:11

mexico

5:12

interesting that could be very useful

5:14

for my research as well

5:15

i'm going to put that up here in

5:18

microsoft word

5:19

so okay now

5:22

um the last step is

5:26

i want to i want to save this website

5:28

i'm going to go to microsoft word

5:30

i'm going to paste the url so i know

5:32

where i found this information

5:34

and let's just summarize this in our own

5:37

words

5:38

okay

5:41

so uh we have

5:45

fifth uh we have the url we have 56

5:48

ethnic and indigenous groups

5:50

okay we have

5:54

we know we learned that indians

6:01

who can't speak spanish

6:06

there is discrimination against

6:09

indians who can't speak spanish um

6:13

low income jobs

6:16

and then we have 40 percent are

6:20

migrant farm workers according to this

6:23

paragraph

6:24

so i just summarized that paragraph so

6:26

i'm done

6:28

next paragraph let's look let's

6:29

summarize this paragraph just what are

6:32

the important facts here we have

6:35

indigenous women

6:38

have i spelled that wrong i don't really

6:41

care let's just auto correct that

6:44

double discrimination okay and we have

6:48

things like

6:48

illiteracy the inability to read

6:51

we have um rape and sexual assault

6:55

in the military okay rape

6:58

sexual assault military

7:03

and

7:03

[Music]

7:07

justice is not administered fairly after

7:09

women report abuse

7:11

the outcome is often heavily in favor of

7:13

the male defendants

7:14

so justice system

7:18

does not basically does not listen to

7:21

women's cases okay

7:25

so that's pretty much everything from

7:26

that paragraph i need delete it

7:29

okay last part um

7:32

okay the government still maintains that

7:35

racial discrimination does not exist

7:37

that's very important okay government

7:41

we'll say mexican government says

7:44

racism does not exist

7:48

it's basically what it's saying right

7:53

it contends that racial discrimination

7:54

is not the cause of poverty

7:56

but poverty is the cause of

7:58

discrimination

8:00

so that's an interesting quote there all

8:02

right

8:03

let's copy that up cut it whatever

8:07

mexican the government says racism does

8:10

not exist

8:11

it states that and i'm going to put

8:14

quotes because i copied it directly

8:17

remember if you copy something directly

8:18

you put quotes and that's everything

8:20

from that paragraph

8:22

so this information here

8:26

is the information i'm going to put in

8:27

my essay

8:29

notice i just took this really big long

8:31

article

8:32

i searched for discrimination i

8:35

copied and pasted in here and then i

8:37

summarized it in my own words

8:38

and now i have information for my

8:40

article okay so that's the process you

8:43

go through

8:43

to find take out information from

8:46

an article that you find for your

8:52

research
## Introduction

0:11

Evaluating sources is an important step in the research process. This tutorial explains criteria

0:17

you should use to evaulate sources, whether they are websites, library books, or articles from

0:23

library databases.

0:26

Use the acronym CRAP to remember the criteria you will use to evaluate sources.

## CRAP Acronym Explanation

0:32

The letters represent Currency, Reliability and Relevance, Authority and Audience, and

0:38

Purpose and Point of View.

0:43

Step 1. To evaluate a source for currency, look for the publication date. If you are researching a

## Currency Explanation and Example

0:50

current news topic, such as an upcoming election issue, timeliness is important.

0:57

If you are researching a subject such as a literary movement or history, a source that is

1:03

20 or more years old may be just as useful as a source published last year.

1:11

This book's record in the library catalog shows the publiction date after the name of the

1:16

publisher. Based on the subject and date, is this book still considered current?

## Relevance Explanation and Example

1:24

Step 2. When evaluating a source for relevance, look for terminology that reflects the focus of

1:31

your research. Determine if the source contains the information you need.

1:37

For example, using the book's record, look for subject headings that describe the item's focus.

1:47

A table of contents or summary of the item might be available to read.

## Reliability Explanation and Example

1:54

Step 3. Look for signs of the item's reliability. Are any references listed? If your source is a

2:01

website, are any links provided? What are the links?

2:05

Additionally, consider whether or not the source has a specific bias or slant of opinion.

2:13

Opinions are helpful if you want to construct a persuasive agrument. When you are looking for

2:17

hard facts, on the other hand, locate sources that are informative rather than persuasive.

2:24

This article has numerous links throughout its contents.

2:29

It also ends with references for additional sources.

## Authority Explanation and Example

2:35

Step 4. Determine the authority responsible for the source. Look for evidence that the author

2:42

or organization is a credible expert on the topic. Often you can find this information within the

2:48

publication itself.

2:52

Let's say that you've located an article by Deborah Tannen. If you conduct a quick search,

2:57

you will see that she is a professor at Georgetown University who has written many

3:01

books and articles about language and communication.

3:07

If you are using a website, look at the website's domain extension. Websites with .edu domains

3:13

are tied to academic institutions. United States government websites have a .gov domain.

3:20

Others to consider are .org for nonprofit organizations that may have a specific opinion

3:26

or agenda, .com for commercial organizations such as Amazon.com, and .net, which may be

3:33

a personal or local community website.

## Audience Explanation and Example

3:39

Step 5. No matter what type of source you are using, it is important to consider the target

3:45

audience. Is the information presented for the general public, for college students, or for

3:51

professionals in a specific trade or research field? Or, is it for an entirely different audience?

3:59

This particular website has sections for kids and for teenagers.

## Purpose and Point of View Explanation and Example

4:06

Step 6. Consideration of the author's purpose and point of view is also important in evaluating

4:13

a source. What is the author's or organization's goal in publishing the information?

4:19

Is the goal to present facts, sell a product, or persuade an audience?

4:25

Additionally, consider whether any ads present detract from the content.

4:32

Is this site's purpose merely to inform or to sell a specific diet?

## Library Contact Information

4:39

For additional help on the CRAP test and evaluating sources, ask a librarian.

# Evaluating Secondary Sources

So you’ve done your research and have gathered a wealth of information – how do you go about trimming this information and deciding what is valid and what is not? Well, have you ever heard about the criteria called **CRAP**? (Don’t worry, we’re not violating the Code of Conduct!)

CRAP is a powerful mnemonic / easy-to-remember tool to help you evaluate your sources. Watch the video below to learn more about CRAP. After you watch ask yourself:

1. Have I understood what **each letter of the acronym CRAP means?**
2. Have I understood the **recommended steps** to follow and **questions to ask** when evaluating sources?

In addition to the CRAP considerations, you can also ask yourself the following additional questions to help you determine if a source is reliable:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/eedec3a2a296602411b8abd68983b3a78a38190e.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T104541Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=24620bfb19905d09b1868897c92d9569ef5b26d751a5b33f81e4e9ef2fe23d0d)

Keep in mind that everything is written from a particular social, cultural, and political perspective. Realize that some publications tend to be ‘slanted’ towards a certain viewpoint.

---

Identify a piece of writing or news that you just read. It can be anything; a newspaper article, an editorial piece or something your uncle forwarded to you on WhatsApp. Use the ==CRAP or SIFT== methods to evaluate the sources used in that piece of writing to determine whether they are legitimate or not. Share what you found, along with the context of the article, with your peers on eHub. Also, read through your peers’ responses to get a better understanding of the different forms of sources and their evaluation.



# Ethical Use of AI Tools for Web Research

  
**Let’s now dive into a fascinating and ever-evolving topic on ethics in the use of AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini for conducting web research.**

We now live in the AI age and as powerful as such tools are and are going to get, it’s important to understand the ethical considerations surrounding their use, especially in learning institutions.

Quick question for you:  

Why do you think the Ethical use of AI tools in web research is a thorny topic?

There are definitely a lot of answers to this question, but the main reasons for the complexities around the ethical use of AI tools in web research are due to concerns related to privacy, data bias, transparency, accountability, misinformation, and regulatory challenges. This necessitates a collaborative effort to establish ethical standards, ensure transparency, and prioritize data protection and user rights.

**Some standards and considerations you can take when using AI tools in your work include:**

- ==Full disclosure:== Always disclose when your work is AI-assisted by properly citing your sources. Passing off AI-generated work purely as your own is something we advise against.
- ==Transparency:== Your users will want to know that the data you are collecting from them will at some point pass through AI tools, which is something not every user is comfortable with!
- ==Responsibility:== Always use AI tools in a moral, ethical, and responsible manner.

**There are also some guiding principles to take into account when using AI tools for web research:**

- Use AI tools to supplement, not replace, human judgment. AI tools can be valuable for research, but they should not be used as a substitute for human judgment. It is important to carefully evaluate the results of AI tools and to use your critical thinking skills to make decisions.
- Be aware of the potential biases of AI tools. AI tools are trained on data that is collected from the real world, and this data can be biased. It is important to be aware of the potential biases of AI tools and to take steps to mitigate them.
- Use AI tools in a way that respects the privacy of others. AI tools can collect a large amount of data about users, and it is important to use this data in a way that respects the privacy of others. This means obtaining informed consent from users before collecting their data and using it only for the purposes that were disclosed to them.

**So now that you understand the ethics of AI-based research, and know what to look out for, let’s see how best to leverage these technologies to your advantage.**

As a principle, you should know that AI assistants like **[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/gpt-4)**, **[Gemini](https://bard.google.com/chat)**, and **[BingAI](https://www.bing.com/search?form=MY0291&OCID=MY0291&q=Bing+AI&showconv=1)** are very powerful, but they cannot do the research for you. They are “assistants” that can help you through the process, but you have to take the lead and make the decisions regarding what is and what is not important.

==Looking for the right information==

Let’s say you’re starting your research and want to know which articles and research papers to read. BingAI has you covered! You can use other assistants like Google’s Gemini to do the same. Just know that some of these language models aren’t connected to the internet and might not be able to provide up-to-date information.

When you’ve found the perfect article or paper that you want to read and analyze as part of your research, you can use AI tools to scan through articles and papers, and provide summaries or pull specific information that you need.

We encourage you to explore. Remember, to use AI ethically and responsibly. There are no shortcuts to life, and AI isn’t here to do your work for you. It’s just here to assist.

Storytelling is a powerful tool that plays an essential role in the workplace. Stories can help to convey complex information in a simple and relatable way, allowing stakeholders to ==better understand and connect== with new ideas and concepts. Sharing progress updates, success stories, and demonstrating growth potential can inspire and motivate.

Additionally, storytelling can help to create a sense of community and foster relationships among colleagues, helping to build a ==positive and productive work environment==. By incorporating storytelling into their communication strategies, organizations can better engage employees and clients, promote collaboration and creativity, and ultimately achieve greater success.

In this module, we will explore writing as a form of storytelling. In subsequent modules, we will explore other forms of telling compelling stories.

When we listen to stories as audience members, we unknowingly respond and make judgments in our head about whether the story resonates or “clicks” with us and how the speaker does this. Below are a few of the characteristics we typically watch out for in the stories we hear and what effective storytellers can do.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/40fa8b3bc7017e2d4417ef8d8d41e3e58458d2aa.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T111506Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=a7cfc208cd6c3a42381db931367a622ab61af8284771d2a6d2043e31946b8eb9)

Finding the right combination of the elements above in your storytelling can convert you into a powerful speaker!

**Now, it’s time for us to see storytelling in action. Listen to the presentations below and remember to watch out for how each speaker uses the different elements of our storytelling rubric:**

- Audience Relevance
- Language
- Voice
- Narratives
- Structuring

#### Video #1: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

**The danger of a single story:** What is the power of a story, especially when only one side gets to tell it? That is what Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a Nigerian novelist, argues in her TED Talk. She shares that a single story about a person or place can be dangerous. She gives an example of her experience of reading books with characters that didn’t look like her and her discovery of African literature that showed her different stories. Let’s watch the video to see how she uses an amazing narrative to explain the power of storytelling.

Storytelling takes place in various forms. Writing is one of the most commonly used forms of communication in the workplace, and it is extremely beneficial to understand the simple steps you can take to create relevant and compelling stories.

### **Steps to Professional Writing**

![Understanding Audience](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1E9ug8KLc73Ez0xmCOiboib8GaARNblxV)**

#### Step 1: Understanding the Audience

**

Who will be reading your writing? What do they already know about the topic? What are their needs and expectations? What kind of language and tone do they respond to most? By understanding your audience, you can tailor your writing to their specific interests and needs.

![Defining Purpose](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UPXCcrNyHGQ--5poHjQEaa0PZVp_yPcu)**

#### Step 2: Defining the Purpose

**

Once you know your audience, the next step is defining the purpose of your writing. What do you want to achieve with your writing? Are you trying to inform, persuade, or entertain? Knowing your purpose will help you stay focused and on track while you’re writing.

![Research Background](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/169YvyVC-AZ7fWBfAUnwrzqM8IV9c75vn)**

#### Step 3: Research Background Information

**

To ensure that your writing includes all essential information, facts, and figures, it is crucial to conduct thorough research on the topic. Including graphs, charts, and images can help illustrate key facts and information.

![Planning and Organizing](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TJtbHuPT8V2eDwEQ3IBoyMistg1yoGhJ)**

#### Step 4: Planning and Organizing

**

Before you start writing, plan and organize your ideas. Create an outline or a mind map to structure your writing. This helps in making your writing more coherent and easy to follow.

![Sticking to One Topic](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dw72CsUSM9Z_2mQGlsszxvMi8IU8W14M)**

#### Step 5: Stick to One Topic

**

Mixing an array of ideas in business writing reduces the effectiveness of the main message. Stay focused on one topic to avoid confusing the reader.

![Writing Clearly and Concisely](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1x29xlyDQnMlHDwrik8C59W81Rpw8gNsM)**

#### Step 6: Writing Clearly and Concisely

**

When it comes to professional writing, clarity and concision are key. Use simple, straightforward language, and avoid jargon or overly technical terms that your audience might not understand. Be concise and to the point, and avoid using unnecessary words or phrases.

![Proofreading and Editing](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VC_imw91f_wNpmV2VlbH-iR3mZp9sIEs)**

#### Step 7: Proofreading and Editing

**

After you’ve finished writing, it’s important to proofread and edit your work. Check for grammar and spelling mistakes, and make sure your writing is clear and easy to understand. Consider asking a colleague, friend, or Chat GPT to review your writing. Having a fresh set of eyes to look at your work can often catch mistakes or areas for improvement that you might have missed.

![Following Writing Etiquette](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1g0c6BLNcqEc8HiZpC9uSf_oLyPC1Tt3L)**

#### Step 8: Following Professional Writing Etiquette

**

In addition to the above principles, there are certain etiquette and formatting rules to follow in professional writing. This might include using proper salutations and closings in emails, using a professional tone and style, and adhering to formatting guidelines such as margins, font size, and spacing.

To write a good story, you need to follow a structured writing process, and most stories follow a particular structure called the **Story Arc**. The Story Arc has several parts, and each of them is essential to create a well-structured story. The following article explains the structure of the Story Arc and provides some amusing examples.

# Creating a Storytelling Outline

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T111941Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=087bc91fa23f51bd422a5750ac36e19b9e8959b0ff7a5932bec2476ec15eae5e)

To create a powerful story arc, it is essential to emphasize Step 3 of the writing process: organizing and planning. An effective tool that we can utilize for this purpose is called an outline.

You may already be familiar with outlines from your previous English classes back in high school. Outlines serve as excellent aids for listing the main parts of your story, ensuring a key message in each section, and connecting all the elements together in a compelling narrative or structure.

We are providing two videos on this page and the next page to give you a sense of two different approaches to outlining your story.

The first video focuses on writing an outline for a speech. Remember, as a tech professional, you won’t always have your computer to hide behind. At times, you will need to address an audience or make a presentation. Having a clearly outlined and engaging speech will be advantageous. Let’s take a look at the video below to understand all the key considerations of a speech outline.

Ask yourself as you watch:

1. Have I understood the flow and order of a speech outline?
2. Have I captured all the various components of a speech outline?
3. Have I understood the importance of the “Opening” and what it ties into?
4. What the “Close” needs to tie back to?

## Introduction

0:04

Hey this is Darren LaCroix how to write a speech your  speech outline the second most important step in  

0:10

the process of creating a great speech first  we need to understand what is our opening the  

## Opening

0:20

opening how are you going to get your attention  and a lot of people talk about all you have to  

0:23

have a attention-getting opening but truly to  have a powerful opening it has to tie in to  

## Premise

0:30

the premise which is number two the premise the  premise is the idea that you're selling whether  

0:38

your corporate presenter trying to get across  a point about the new 401k plan an entrepreneur  

0:43

promoting your business or a professional  keynote speaker the premise is the core and  

0:48

the reason for this presentation then we have  the body is the next step now that may be one,  

## Body

0:56

two, or three points that we're trying to get  across then we would have next your call for  

1:08

action what are you trying to get the audience  to do do you want them to sign up for the new 40k  

1:12

plan do you want them to believe in themselves  do you want to go take action what do you want  

1:17

them to do and then finally your clothes we want  a strong clothes but here's the key for a great  

## Clothes

1:26

outline of a speech if there's any way possible  we want the clothes to tie back to the opening  

1:34

this really gives you that circular effect and  gives a the audience the idea that you're fully  

1:41

prepared that you know what you're doing and  it really makes you look like a pro so you're  

1:45

opening your premise state that the body maybe  have one to three points a call for action and  

1:52

then a strong close and whenever we can tie it  back to the opening I was at a convention this  

1:57

weekend and I was coaching someone and he had  a great opening and a great close but both of  

2:02

them had nothing to do with his premise but  he wasn't aware of that so for you make sure

0:04

Have you ever wondered how much ice cream you can get for a dollar?

0:07

Or what's the cheapest thing in an airport?

0:09

Or if it's faster to go inside or a drive-through?

0:12

Probably not.

0:14

But somehow, answering these weird questions

0:16

and sharing those experiences

0:18

have become my life's work.

0:20

Now even though I only have five minutes to share my viral storytelling framework,

0:24

great stories should be told in less than 60 seconds.

0:28

And it's not just about becoming a viral social media star.

0:31

It's about making your conversations better,

0:33

whether you’re with friends, family

0:35

or trying to convince your boss for a raise.

0:38

So here's how to make every second count.

0:41

Many great stories start with a question,

0:43

because it will make people stick until the end to find out the answer.

0:48

And remember, you want to get your audience's attention immediately,

0:51

so you want to start by asking something shocking.

0:53

And one of the things I've always wondered

0:56

was if fast food was really as fast as they say.

0:58

So I answered just this in a video

1:00

and got over 45 million views.

1:01

Let's check out how I hooked my viewers.

1:04

(Video) Can I have a burger?

1:05

Can you put cheese, lettuce and tomatoes? This thing's not hot enough.

1:08

(Laughter)

1:09

(Stage) That thing really wasn't hot enough.

1:13

But as you can see, I took this question very seriously.

1:17

And after you've hooked your audience, you want to take them on a journey,

1:20

building up to your answer,

1:21

where you want them to feel constant progression,

1:24

so we're moving closer and closer to our answer

1:27

so we feel like we can't stop listening.

1:30

And in my case, I did just this by saying

1:33

that I’ll be adding tomatoes, lettuce and cheese to the burger,

1:36

so now we know how close I am to finishing the competition, thus the video.

1:42

But if everything is smooth sailing, then nobody cares,

1:46

which is why we need to add conflict before getting to our answer.

1:50

So here's how I did that.

1:51

(Video) Yes, please. And cheese.

1:53

Mother: There's smoke in here.

1:54

Jenny Hoyos: This thing is still raw. Good thing there's a line.

1:57

Oh my goodness.

1:59

Mother: What are you doing? You're going to burn that car.

2:01

JH: I'll cut the tomatoes while this cooks.

2:03

Mother: I hope I don't have to eat that.

2:05

JH: Tell them to slow down.

2:07

Mother: You're doing all this for one subscriber?

2:09

You're going to make a mess.

2:11

JH: Put the ketchup on the buns.

2:14

(Stage) As you saw, without conflict, the audience just isn’t as invested,

2:20

which is why I used my mom as the B plot.

2:22

So you’re now not only invested in the competition

2:25

but also curious to see what's going to happen between my mom and I.

2:30

And after enough buildup, we finally need our answers.

2:36

Will I cook the burger faster?

2:38

Will I accidentally set my mom’s car on fire?

2:41

The key here is to build tension by making the answer feel uncertain

2:45

to make a satisfying ending.

2:47

Here's how I did just that.

2:49

(Video) We’re one person away.

2:50

We just need the burger to cook faster.

2:52

Mother: We're moving, we're moving.

2:54

JH: No, my burger is not done yet. You're driving too crazy.

2:58

It needs to cook faster.

3:00

Mother: We're next.

3:02

(Music)

3:04

JH: We're pulling up to the window.

3:06

(Music)

3:07

And, oh my goodness!

3:08

(Music)

3:13

We cooked faster and better.

3:16

(Laughter)

3:18

(Applause)

3:20

And that's it. We cooked faster than the drive-through.

3:22

Does it matter that my burger was basically raw?

3:25

Absolutely not.

3:27

Because the viewers wanted an answer,

3:28

so I gave it to them quickly and concisely, in an engaging way,

3:32

which led our video to getting over 45 million views.

3:36

And you might be impressed to know

3:38

that instead of telling this talk in five minutes, I actually did it in four,

3:42

so you now have an extra minute to practice your 60-second story.

3:46

(Laughter)

3:47

Because if it takes longer to tell your story than it does to make a burger,

3:51

then you're probably overcooking both.

3:53

(Laughter)

3:54

Thank you.

3:55

(Cheers and applause)# Writing Best Practices

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T142032Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=e60749d514e5e9f99ff9a8b3c4a20b4f2b342b74e7e6e56e7cc649b3defd7676)

Now that you have learned about story arcs and outlines, it’s time to start writing!

In addition to the writing process we discussed earlier, writing has best practices that one should follow to tell compelling stories. Let’s look at these best practices from a broader communication standpoint, and then from a writing perspective.

#### **Communication Best Practices**

When you are writing to communicate information, your writing must meet these 7 key elements. They’re also called the “7 C’s of Communication”.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/ba9301ff8d5eed776149db7046daefb1e5cb4bf2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T142032Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=f9d96f4615df1d5a1079420f068a9dba137343cc409f0daf615e18141dfc07c2)

#### **Writing Best Practices**

With the 7C’s of communication in mind, let’s focus a little more on writing to tell a story or communicate.

Now take time to read this **[business article](https://www.grammarly.com/business/learn/top-principles-effective-business-writing/)** that gives specific writing best practices. As you read, take note of the 8 elements of good writing.

# Technical Writing

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T142140Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=90cb9e05817f519cf7955782e2539ad22127eb4a544c95c5ceb1311c98227c41)

  

Generally, the tips that you have already learned apply to any kind of writing. As a young tech professional, you will likely be asked at some point to read and/or produce _technical writing._

Technical writing is a form of communication that conveys complex technical or specialized information in a clear and concise manner to a specific audience. It is usually used for the purpose of informing, instructing, or facilitating decision-making.

Technical writing requires both creativity and logic so that technical information can be clearly explained to a specified audience. In good technical writing, complex concepts and processes are broken down into easy-to-understand language. It is common that diagrams, charts, and other visual storytelling aids are used. Technical writers may create a variety of documents, such as user manuals, technical specifications, training materials, and research reports.

Examples of Technical Writing

- User manuals for software or hardware products, which provide step-by-step instructions on how to use them.
- Technical specifications for products or systems, which detail the technical requirements and capabilities of a product.
- Training materials for employees or customers, which teach them how to perform specific tasks or use specific tools.
- White papers or research reports, which communicate the results of technical research or analysis to a wider audience.
- Safety manuals or procedures, which provide guidelines and instructions on how to safely use equipment or handle hazardous materials.

Technical writing plays a critical role in bridging the gap between technical experts and their intended audiences, making complex information accessible and usable for a wide range of readers.

Let’s meet and watch technical writers from Google as they share insights on the importance of technical writing and the paramount role played by technical writers in the world of tech.

As you watch this 2-minute video, ask yourself:

- Have I understood the role that technical writing plays in the tech world?
- What considerations do technical writers make to call their work a success?

#### This is insanely cool!

And did you notice how the user is at the core of the technical writing process?

---

==Writing and storytelling== play a pivotal role in tech to effectively communicate information within the company and to users. Learn those writing skills and hold on to them. They will boost your contribution to the world of tech.

Share your thoughts on the importance of technical writing with your peers on eHub, and see what they are sharing as well.

Share on eHub

According to a survey, here are some interesting findings that are relevant to the workplace:

- Spelling and grammar mistakes are unacceptable in most workspaces.
- Certain industries view typos more harshly.
- Managers are likely to be critical of typos.
- Resume errors can cost you the job.
- People who think they are great at spelling, grammar, and reading comprehension often are not as strong in these areas as they think _(ouch!)_

Reflection Questions:  

Does knowing grammar and spelling still matter in the World of AI-aided writing and acronyms? **Share your thoughts and reasons in your squad, and see what others are saying!**

# The Power of Storytelling

  

“A powerful story can change the world.”  

After watching and listening to some of the stories we shared in the previous module, do you believe the above statement is true?

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/9901fc04f62836f129ad7fd339c21a36035c4a1e.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T143130Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c07500bdfde2750b7b81effc3e298bbce6feaa7db2804cf3475eee9c91bbfef3)

Now that you have learned a little bit about what makes a powerful story, how to design it into an overall arc, and how to put your writing to the test, let’s discuss how you can leverage storytelling as a tool to illustrate the problems that matter to you and that you are seeing in your communities today.

==With a single story, we can…==

- Inspire individuals to join our cause
- Encourage donors to fund our projects
- Illustrate our organization’s impact
- …and many more!

Let’s see how leaders and changemakers have used stories to maximize their impact!

# The Stories Behind Our Problems 1

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T143217Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=b40de651e9e601e7fee69b2ebe15fab0b9286e2b8daf000983bbc43042b3ce78)  

Each of us has a passion, cause, or interest we are fighting for. This much is clear to us through the GCGOs we feel most affiliated/connected to. We read articles, gather facts, and do our research (as we have already done) to understand these problems more deeply.

But not everyone understands or feels as connected to these problems as we do. Because of that, we must harness the power of stories.

#### Why are stories a great way to illustrate these problems?

- Relatability: Stories have a way of grounding the problem in a reality that the average person can relate to.
- Empathy / Sympathy: Stories can show how a big problem affects people’s lives in a way that elicits an emotional reaction.
- Concreteness: Stories can also show how large, complex problems have a real effect on daily life as opposed to relying on statistics.

**Over the next pages, we will watch 3 videos to learn how three leaders have used stories to illustrate the problems they are trying to solve.**

As you watch, pay close attention to the effectiveness of the storytelling and the impact it creates for the audience in each example.

#### **Story 1: Sangu Delle uses a personal story as an impactful teaser for his speech.**

Share on eHub0:04

In West Africa, where I live,

0:06

there are 60 million smallholder farmers.

0:09

Smallholder farmers are the largest group

0:11

of people living on less than two dollars a day.

0:14

Many go hungry each year because they don't grow enough to eat.

0:18

Government subsidies,

0:19

which could be as much as 90 million in a single year for a country,

0:23

don’t meet full demand

0:24

and are often driven to large farms and male farmers,

0:28

even though women are the backbone of farming in Africa.

0:32

Despite these investments,

0:33

yields per hectare haven’t increased significantly in over four decades.

0:39

So smallholder farmers earn the bulk of their cash at harvest time,

0:44

but then, fast-forward nine months later, at planting time, they're cash-poor again.

0:49

The prevailing assumption is that farmers need grants,

0:52

subsidies or credit

0:53

in order to be able to invest in their farms.

0:56

But we found a surprising insight.

0:59

The fundamental problem isn't that farmers have no cash.

1:03

It's that they don't have it when they need it.

1:06

I first came across this paradox in 2008,

1:09

when I was working in microcredit.

1:11

Farmers would ask me things like,

1:13

“Can I over-repay my loan for next year’s loan?”

1:17

or, “Hey, could I repay my loan a year in advance?”

1:21

Even though they were using the language of credit,

1:24

what they were actually describing was a need to save.

1:29

But do farmers have any money to save?

1:32

Do people living on less than two dollars a day

1:35

have any money to save?

1:37

Well, it turns out that they do,

1:39

just in very small increments.

1:41

At a local market, they might sell a few eggs for a dollar,

1:44

or sell a goat for 10,

1:46

work on someone else's farm,

1:47

and over time, you can imagine how that money could add up.

1:52

But many farmers live far away from banks,

1:54

so they hold that money on them, or they hide it at home,

1:57

where it's at risk of theft, fire, even flood.

2:02

And hey, even without those risks, money at home is tempting.

2:05

It's hard to hold on to cash.

2:08

And sometimes, the smartest thing to do might be to spend it.

2:13

So the real problem that farmers face is that they lack a safe place to save.

2:19

And if they could save,

2:20

they could afford to buy what they need to make their farms more productive

2:24

and resilient to climate change.

2:26

This is a 100-billion-dollar problem in sub-Saharan Africa each year.

2:32

Setou, a peanut farmer in Mali, was facing a similar challenge.

2:36

When we met in 2014, she was feeling overwhelmed.

2:40

Climate change was hurting her harvest,

2:42

and at planting time,

2:43

she didn't even have money to rent a cow to plow her farm,

2:47

let alone money for improved seeds and fertilizer.

2:51

But we realized she could have saved for what she needed

2:54

if she had a safe place to do so.

2:58

Our nonprofit, myAgro, helps farmers in Mali, Senegal and Tanzania

3:02

save up, little by little,

3:04

for the improved seeds and fertilizer they need.

3:07

Together, these help improve harvests

3:11

and generate a 3x return on their investment.

3:15

Here's how the program works.

3:17

We start with a young entrepreneur like Demba.

3:20

We equip him with a smartphone and our app, myAgro Connect,

3:24

so that he can manage his sales territory.

3:27

At harvest time, Demba visits farmers in his village

3:29

and asks them if they want to sign up for a myAgro package

3:32

to improve their harvest and income.

3:35

After a farmer signs up,

3:37

they can pay slowly, over the course of nine months.

3:41

To collect their savings payments,

3:43

we replicate the way people buy prepaid minutes for their phone.

3:47

It's really simple --

3:49

you buy a scratch card, scratch off the back,

3:52

and a unique code appears,

3:54

which you text in to validate your payment.

3:57

We use the same technology to help farmers save up for the planting period,

4:02

and because farmers are familiar with how it works,

4:04

they trust it and use it correctly.

4:07

It's also so much more transparent than traditional methods,

4:10

which is usually, you hand over your cash to an agent, without any receipt.

4:15

With our platform,

4:16

we know exactly who has made a payment

4:18

and when and how much the village entrepreneur needs to transfer to us.

4:22

A farmer can also pay directly via mobile money, if they have it.

4:28

Farmers are able to save up in a way that's joyful.

4:31

They often hold on to their scratch cards,

4:33

and they look at them with awe and pride

4:36

of how much they've been able to save over time.

4:39

It's transparent, convenient and stress-free.

4:42

Tell me, when was the last time your bank made you that happy?

4:45

(Laughter)

4:47

(Applause)

4:48

Designing --

4:49

(Applause)

4:51

Designing a savings plan this way has made it particularly easy for women.

4:56

They value the democratic access to seeds and fertilizer,

5:00

and the savings cadence matches the small amounts of money

5:02

they earn each week at local markets.

5:06

In a region where 20 percent of women own a bank account,

5:09

60 percent of myAgro farmers are women.

5:14

In 2021, the average myAgro farmer grew two times more food

5:18

than non-myAgro farmers in the same area.

5:21

This translates to 200 dollars of additional net income.

5:26

For context, for a farmer living on 1.50 per day,

5:29

that's a 35 percent increase.

5:32

And by expanding the purchasing power for smallholder farmers,

5:36

the financial prospects of young entrepreneurs like Dembe

5:39

are also improving.

5:41

Before myAgro, he was doing OK selling goods on his own,

5:45

but now, selling seeds and fertilizer to his community via our model,

5:48

he is thriving.

5:50

He bought two freezers to expand his business,

5:53

and he dreams of building a home for his family.

5:56

Last year, Dembe served 400 farmers in his village.

6:01

Using a savings-led model has many benefits.

6:04

For the farmers, it's reliable and low-stress.

6:07

For the organization,

6:08

it means we don't need to raise large amounts of working capital each year.

6:12

Instead, we're unlocking capital from farmers directly.

6:16

And by offering farmers a trusted and transparent way

6:20

to save their own money,

6:22

they are breaking the cycle of poverty for their families

6:25

and entering a cycle of investment and growth.

6:29

Meanwhile,

6:30

Setou has transformed her life,

6:33

all with the power of her own savings and farming.

6:37

In 2014, she decided to try us

6:39

and planted a quarter of her peanut farm with us.

6:42

Each year, with her increased profits,

6:44

she reinvested a portion in building her assets.

6:48

Today, she owns ten cows,

6:50

which she rents out to her neighbors to earn additional income.

6:53

(Applause)

6:59

Last year, she planted her entire one-hectare peanut farm with myAgro.

7:05

And with her profit,

7:06

she proudly moved her family from their one-bedroom home ...

7:10

to this.

7:12

(Cheers and applause)

7:18

And now, the next generation is benefiting from Setou’s smart farm investments.

7:23

When we get this model to scale, it will be transformational.

7:27

Today, we serve over 100,000 farmers,

7:30

and with investments in data and technology,

7:33

our audacious vision is to reach one million farmers

7:36

in the next five years.

7:38

(Cheers and applause)

7:44

We believe we can harness the power of farmers' own savings

7:47

to greatly reduce poverty and hunger in West Africa.

7:50

Now is the time to use a savings-led approach

7:53

to ending poverty for farmers.

7:55

Thank you.

7:56

(Cheers and applause)

It’s great to see that you’re now convinced of the power of storytelling in illustrating the problems we encounter in the world.

Storytelling is a fun and effective way to tackle problems because it:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/186299602292e01ad1f21d6ac10c5faeb066e5e7.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T165655Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=8295f3d72e2026b75bd2f57309c2961b54f2aa0354fecbf8017263dc2a5ede2e)

---

Now, let’s dive into getting started with storytelling for problem-solving.

#### **The best way to start is by conducting a ==Problem Impact Assessment.==**

A Problem Impact Assessment helps you understand the primary stakeholders affected by the problem and how it impacts them. Recall the problem statement you crafted last week and take a moment to review it. Then, ask yourself the following questions:

- Which groups of people are primarily impacted by this problem?

- Individuals: Consider age groups, specific sectors, and geographic location.
- Corporations: Think about industries, business size, and functional areas.
- Public Entities: Include governments at different levels, non-profits, and NGOs.
- Multi-national Organizations

- How does the problem affect each group? Consider areas such as lifestyle and quality of life, labour conditions, health and well-being (physical, mental, emotional), efficiency and productivity, safety and protection.
- How does this impact manifest in their everyday lives? Think about how the problem affects their daily routines and experiences.
- How does this impact change their quality of life or outcomes? Explore how the problem alters their overall well-being and results.

By addressing these questions, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to illustrate the impact of the problem more powerfully through storytelling.
# Individual Activity: Problem Impact Assessment

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/f5865018ddac73e42bb695b3b3a22299f74abaa4.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T165921Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=74cc27fac8bddff2e991c4ee78373f937d8079c229b8bdee3cf76dff2fdbb6c5)

  

#### This activity will take you a step closer to defining some of the details you will need for your Week 4 Milestone submission.

Open a new Google Doc and label it **“Problem Impact Assessment”**. Using the guide questions you just received on conducting a Problem Impact Assessment, craft a compelling 1-page reflection on how your chosen problem affects different groups of stakeholders.

 ==1 -== Start by revisiting your problem statement from last week.

---

==2 -== Identify the primary groups of stakeholders impacted by the problem. Consider individuals, corporations, public entities, and multinational organizations.

---

==3 -== Address the Problem Impact Assessment questions for each stakeholder group. Be concrete and vivid in your descriptions to create a powerful reflection.

---

==4 -== Focus on specific details such as age groups, sectors, geographic locations, industries, business sizes, functional areas, government levels, non-profits, NGOs, and multinational organizations.

---

==5 -== Dive into the effects of the problem on each group, exploring aspects like lifestyle and quality of life, labour conditions, health and well-being (physical, mental, emotional), efficiency and productivity, safety, and protection.

---

==6 -== Paint a vivid picture of how the impact manifests in their everyday lives, capturing the challenges and obstacles they face.

---

==7 -== Highlight the transformative effects on their quality of life and outcomes, illustrating the significance of the problem for each stakeholder group.

---

Remember to proofread your reflection for grammar and spelling.

Crafting Powerful Stories

  
Now, let’s talk about how to convert your Problem Impact Assessment into an actual story. For this, don’t forget to use some of the tips and tricks you learned in the last module about how to build a powerful Story Arc.





Want to learn more about how to start crafting your story? Continue to read this article on using stories to describe a problem you are solving.

The steps above give you some skeleton/structure for an initial story. Next, we will learn about some extra steps you can take to refine your story further and make it as powerful as possible.

# Stakeholder vs Audience

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T170015Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=dc621700749991a44ebd4bce7665215a5fcc29fabf39c0ef2613f6c2262d3fb7)  

Now that you have understood your chosen GCGO problem (Problem Statement), the stakeholders it affects (Problem Impact Assessment), and the stakeholder you want to use as your protagonist in your story—it is time to understand your ==audience==. Who are you telling your story to?

The stakeholders and your audience are distinct entities. Click the interactives below to learn more about them.

**Stakeholders**

These are the individuals or groups directly affected by the problem. When considering the impact on stakeholders, think about their experiences, challenges, and needs related to the issue. Understanding their perspective will help you create a more impactful and relevant story.

**Audience**

Your audience is the group of people you are presenting your story to. They may include stakeholders, as well as others who may not have direct involvement but have an interest in the topic. Tailor your story to resonate with the audience’s interests, values, and motivations. Consider how the story can engage, educate, or inspire them to take action or change their perspective.

#### Yes, we care and knew you needed that clarity 🙂

# Understanding Your Audience

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T170037Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=efb10381c3c86f7aa16a85a226bdd483206a008cde9f18006900c3ec83197aaa)  

To improve on your story, it is also important to think about the audience that will be hearing it. To do so, you can ask yourself the following questions about your audience:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/285e66540f7f515b47f376f0afca77dd58eed8b5.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T170037Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=adfc5f74d27fb4ce7a04bfceea4fde43a0f5b2afb29354b2793f5af237e4bb8b)# Using Ethos, Pathos & Logos

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T170059Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=e9300302d2c8cfba03ad2386d62f2ac997633b59e7abd2c7535cb45bd82e09d9)  

In addition to understanding your audience, you can also employ some “persuasive appeals” to make your message more effective.

These are ethos, logos, and pathos. Watch the video below to learn about what each of these appeals can do and how to employ them successfully.

Ask yourself as you watch:

1. Have I grasped the meaning of each appeal?
2. Have I understood how logos, ethos, and pathos differ?
3. How does “audience awareness” come into play?

:01

the three persuasive appeals logos ethos

0:04

and

0:07

posos 2,300 years ago famous philosopher

0:10

Aristotle argued that there were three

0:12

ways to persuade someone and these three

0:15

persuasion appeals are the same modes of

0:17

persuasion used today by politicians

0:20

advertisements and public speakers

0:25

alike the first persuasive appeal is

0:27

logos or logical appeal logos is

0:30

persuading by appealing to one's logical

0:32

side through reason often through facts

0:34

statistics charts and

0:38

graphs the second persuasive appeal is

0:41

ethos or credibility appeal ethos is

0:43

persuading by establishing that the

0:45

Persuader is trustworthy often through

0:47

showing where one's information came

0:49

from or by using an expert or

0:54

testimonial the last persuasive appeal

0:56

and often the most effective is posos or

0:59

emotional appeal

1:00

p is persuading by appealing to one's

1:02

emotions and by creating an emotional

1:04

response such as sadness or

1:08

happiness it is also important to note

1:10

that good persuaders keep in mind the

1:12

target audience when using logos ethos

1:14

and posos this is called audience

1:18

awareness after all it wouldn't make

1:20

sense to show a toy commercial during a

1:22

late night talk

1:25

show in the end it's important to use a

1:28

balance of all three persuasive appeals

1:30

this will keep your audience engaged

1:32

while keeping their trust in

1:36

you so next time you're aiming to

1:38

persuade someone use all three

1:40

persuasive appeals then you can tell

1:42

everyone you're cool like

1:46

Aristotle

# Identifying Key Messages

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T172003Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=964e6b1160c201f0b6dc0aa2a9adbc6e8eb9f53321bd5b52de4be655833c4481)  

Finally, you can ensure maximum effectiveness for your story if you are clear on the key messages you want to make sure your audience hears/understands/realizes.

Part of this is thinking through how you want your audience to **FEEL**, what you want them to **THINK**, and what you need them to **KNOW** after hearing your story. Once you understand these three things, you can work backwards to determine how you want to position the key messages of your story.

Let’s think about it…  

If you want your audience to feel **infuriated/angry** after your presentation, maybe you focus on a story of **injustice**.

If you want your audience to think that they have a **role they can play**, maybe you can share a story of how **one person was able to make a difference.**

If you want your audience to know about how the **system is broken**, maybe you can focus on a story of **inefficiency and wastage.**

==Makes sense, right?== First, decide on the end goal of your story, and then work backwards to effectively shape and position your key message.

You’re soon going to be part of technology teams in startups and big established corporates. While there may be different communication requirements for different roles, **good written communication is crucial throughout a product’s development lifecycle** and might mean the difference between a successful and a bad product release.

As a new entrant in tech, it’s important to understand the benefits of effective written communication within teams and organizations. Here are some of the reasons why:

- ==Clarity:== Agile teams need to work quickly and efficiently, and good written communication helps ensure that everyone is on the same page. When team members communicate clearly in writing, there’s less room for confusion, misunderstandings, or delays caused by having to clarify information.
- ==Documentation:== Agile development often involves making changes quickly, and good written communication is essential for documenting those changes. Written communication, such as emails or chat messages, can serve as a record of decisions made, problems encountered, and solutions implemented, which can be used for future reference.
- ==Collaboration:== Agile development relies on collaboration between team members, and written communication is a key tool for making that collaboration work. Good written communication can help ensure that team members are sharing ideas and working together effectively, even if they’re not in the same physical location.
- ==Remote work:== In recent times, remote work has become increasingly common in technology companies, and good written communication is especially important in remote teams. Written communication can help ensure that remote team members stay connected and informed, despite not being in the same location. Think of the fact that we’re able to attend class at ALX today from different cities across the world with no technical hitches!

_**The numbers below correspond to the numbers in red in the image above.**_

1. **Good subject line** to help viewers understand what an update is about.
2. **Know the audience** you’re trying to communicate with.
3. **Give context** to stakeholders on why this communication is important.
4. **Next steps:**
5. **Clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language** overall.

Topic Exercise

If you’re subscribed or signed up for any app or digital product, you must have received release notes or release announcements with every update. For example, if you have the WhatsApp app on your phone, you’ll find the latest release notes about the app in the App Store or Play Store. Look at some of these release notes or announcements in your inbox or application stores and see how many of the elements discussed here are found in them as well.

# Common Written Communication for Agile Teams: Stand-Up Updates

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T172528Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=5f7446ba734be0b2dd97229b690337ae461df4e3c69a9bcd43d6319be08e2fb0)  

Stand-up meetings are scheduled within a team so that team members can coordinate, collaborate, and foster transparency in their workflows. They’re also known as **SCRUM** meetings and serve as a quick and informal way for team members to share updates, align their efforts, and address any potential obstacles or blockers.

Instead of stand-up meetings, some teams opt for an informal format where team members post their updates in a commonly shared communication channel such as Microsoft Teams or Slack. In general, when communicating with team members on a shared communication channel, keep the following tips in mind. Click through the interactives below to learn more about each tip.

1. Use clear and concise language

When using team collaboration and communication platforms such as Slack or Teams, be brief and to the point. Assume that the people to whom you’re sending a message have loads of other messages to look at, so you’re only trying to capture their attention momentarily. Avoid unnecessary jargon and use plain language to ensure everyone understands the message quickly.

2. Utilize the relevant channels

When making an update regarding the progress of tasks assigned to you, make sure you use the appropriate channels. For instance, there will most likely be a dedicated channel (think of channels as stakeholder groups) for making stand-up updates for the team. Posting a stand-up message on a channel meant for sharing funny tech memes 💀 will probably defeat the purpose of the stand-up update. Don’t you think so?

3. Leverage threads for in-depth discussions

When an update is made to a channel and a discussion stems out of the update, lean towards creating responses on the thread as shown in the example below borrowed from Slack. Replying through starting a new update breaks the flow of the message intended to be communicated.

4. Use @mentions effectively

When you need actions on tasks to be handled by team members, make sure to mention them in your update which ensures full transparency into who should handle what, which should never be assumed. When the @mention list is too large for a collaboration platform update such as Slack, make use of emails!

5. Set clear expectations for response time

If something is needed for an upcoming release that’s bound to happen in three hours, it should be highlighted in the message to enable your intended audience to understand the time urgency required in their responses or actions.

6. Respect teammates working in different time zones

When working with teammates spread across vast geographical areas, consider their off-focus work hours. Unless something is time-critical and super urgent, it might suffice to mention that their response is only required when they’re back to their normal office hours.

7. Encourage positive and constructive communication

All forms of communication in professional teams, such as the ones you’re soon going to be leaders of, should always be respectful and empathetic. It’s always wise to proofread a message you’ve drafted to catch any instances where your emotions and/or language might be too strong for a professional audience.

In principle, it’s important to understand how different collaboration platforms cater to our different communication needs and when to use each. It’s also important to know when to make a publicly facing update in one of the channels we talked about versus reaching out privately to the person whose attention you need on something.

### User-facing and Technical Documentation

In your near future roles in technology teams, documentation writing is going to become a staple when churning out hardware or software products.

You’ve probably tried to use new software or hardware products before, right? What did you do when you couldn’t figure out how to use a particular feature? You used Google Search or consulted a physical manual that came with the product in question to help guide you through your challenge. The documentation we use in this instance is known as **user-facing documentation** and is integral when a technology team is doing hardware and software releases.

Software and hardware that’s being developed also need to be documented every step of the way. This is also known as _technical documentation_ since its main purpose is to act as a reservoir of information for the technology teams.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/1de2c56e2a3021aabfb9d8d4051001f9e3a0d5c2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T172607Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=7d52c3de592516da52721aa25c7df883db7a8a542d5b7dda5e95756e77878b64)

---

There are several reasons why maintaining technical documentation is crucial to a team’s success. Let’s discuss.

Knowledge Preservation and Sharing

Documentation does serve as a repository of information that captures the collective knowledge and expertise of the team over time. It helps with making sure everyone on the team has the most up-to-date information regarding the software project in question which is great for collaboration.

Onboarding and Team Expansion

Documentation serves as an important resource when onboarding new team members to new roles providing them with a comprehensive understanding of the project, its components, and existing processes. Can you try to imagine what would happen if your first professional role was a technology team with no documentation?

Maintaining Consistency

Agile teams often work on complex projects that involve multiple iterations, sprints, or releases. Documentation ensures consistency in development practices, coding standards, and architectural decisions. It serves as a reference point for the team, ensuring that everyone follows the same guidelines and practices, even as the project evolves.

Communication and Collaboration

Agile teams often work with stakeholders, clients, or other teams within an organization. Documentation helps facilitate effective communication and collaboration. It provides a common reference point that can be shared with external stakeholders or non-technical team members to ensure a shared understanding of the project’s scope, progress, and technical aspects.

Continuous Improvement

Agile methodologies emphasize learning and continuous improvement. Documentation plays a crucial role in this process. By documenting lessons learned, feedback, and retrospective outcomes, teams can identify areas of improvement and implement changes effectively.

### Product Requirement Document

You may come across two types of commonly used documents that are commonly used in software development: **PRD - Product Requirements Document** and **BRD - Business Requirements Document.** While they may seem similar at first glance, they serve different purposes in the software development process.

A **Product Requirements Document** is a document that outlines the product requirements for a software application. It’s typically written by the product manager or business analyst and is used to communicate the product vision and requirements to the development team. The PRD outlines the key features, functionality, and user requirements for the product. It also provides details on the user interface, performance requirements, and any other non-functional requirements.

==Example:== A PRD for a mobile app might include details on the user interface design, the login process, the app’s core functionality, and any performance requirements such as load time or response time. Below, is an example you can look at. You do not need to read the document; just scan through it to get a sense of what a PRD looks like.

#### **[Example Product Requirements Document (PRD)](https://www.hustlebadger.com/what-do-product-teams-do/prd-template-examples/)**

### Business Requirements Document

A **Business Requirements Document** is a document that outlines the business requirements for a software application. It’s typically written by a business analyst or project manager and is used to communicate the business requirements to the development team. The BRD outlines the business objectives, user needs, and overall project scope.

==Example:== A BRD for an e-commerce website might include details on the target audience, the business goals for the website, the user journey from product search to purchase, and any integration requirements with third-party systems such as payment gateways or inventory management systems.

The key difference between a PRD and a BRD is the focus of the document. The PRD focuses on the product requirements and features, while the BRD focuses on the business objectives and project scope. In practice, both documents are often used together to ensure that the development team has a complete understanding of both the business requirements and the product requirements. Below, is an example you can look at. You do not need to read the document; just scan through it to get a sense of what a BRD looks like.

#### **[Sample Business Requirements Document (BRD)](https://www.smartsheet.com/content/business-requirement-document-templates)**

  

In general, **a PRD is used when developing new software products or major feature releases**, while **a BRD is used when developing systems that support the business goals of an organization.**

#### Any activity that requires several steps can be called a project.

Some projects, like building a 70-story building in the middle of Addis, require a lot of resources, time, and skilled people. Others, like building a motherboard for a personal computer, may only call for a few specific resources and 1 - 2 pairs of hands. In each case, specified actions must be carried out, sometimes by different people and in a particular order, to accomplish the primary objective.

Your Phase 2 collaboration will require several steps to be complete and can be rightfully called a project. Now that you know you have Phase 2 around the corner, you will need to at least plan out your next 4 weeks to ensure you can complete all aspects of the team project collaborations! **Think about ways you can create more time for yourself in Phase 2.** What can you do and when? What can you delegate? **What do you need for your Phase 2 to be structured for success?**

Embarking on any project necessitates a well-crafted plan that outlines the tasks and activities essential for achieving your project’s goals. This is where a work plan comes in handy. **A work plan is a meticulous blueprint,** mapping out the tasks, timelines, allocated resources, and responsibilities required to bring your project to fruition. It serves as a compass for project managers, enabling them to track progress, manage resources efficiently, and navigate potential obstacles.

We know that you are curious to see what a simple work plan looks like. **[Here is an example of one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PCceAgVMr2ryR9wjyQaZrtoxC1QSb3Uwwx_lSr-P8_k/copy)** that we created. No need to start completing it now. We will come back to creating your own work plan at the end of the module.

  
Since we are already talking about work plans, **let’s take a quick detour and explore other key Project Management considerations through a professional (workspace) lens.** Don’t worry, we’ll quickly absorb this valuable knowledge and then dash back to crafting your personalized work plan for the next few weeks.

# Project Scope

In the project management process, project scoping typically comes before work planning, so let’s talk about that next.

Project scope is a crucial component of project planning as it involves determining a list of specific project goals, deliverables, tasks, costs, and deadlines.

- It outlines the project’s boundaries to help the project owner/team remain focused on the task at hand and procedures for how completed work will be verified and approved.
- A project’s scope also describes the project’s purpose, what is included and isn’t, and important processes, assumptions, and limits.
- A scope is sometimes referred to as a statement of work (SOW), or terms of reference (ToR).

Take a moment to watch this video that breaks down a Project Scope Statement from a professional perspective. As you watch, check your understanding with these guiding questions:

- What are the elements that need to be included in a project scope statement?
- What does each element entail?

---

==To recap,== an effective project scope statement will include the following elements:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T175257Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=673d641a0d141c75991eaaaf84c4bcdc8228be6d51d20528767b9f8e4566a07b)

  
Have you ever come up with a great plan, but when you were executing it, you kept adding (or removing) aspects of it and then ended up with a different plan altogether? It is almost like planning to go to the store to buy food for tomorrow, then on your way, you remember that you need to pass by a friend’s. You decide to change your original plan and pass by your friend’s but never end up making it to the store.

In project management, we call this Scope Creep. Every project should start with a set of agreed-upon project requirements, but scope creep occurs when those needs are increased without permission or other safeguards. Scope creep – also known as feature creep, focus creep, creeping functionality, and kitchen-sink syndrome – can sneak up and destroy a project.

In any project, there tends to be a gap between what was planned and what actually happened. The addition of new objectives, deliverables, or tasks during the life of a project is known as scope creep because it essentially grows your scope steadily until you have more on your plate than you can handle.

**Take a moment to study this article that shares insight on **[Managing Scope Creep In Project Management](https://www.villanovau.com/resources/project-management/project-management-scope-creep/#.WUjZNxOGN-V)**.**

Then, before we move on, watch this video from Mike Clayton. As you watch, make note of two important points:

- What is scope creep, and
- How to manage it.

Part of planning a project is to understand what resources are needed at each stage. This can be challenging at first glance. Do you think that the Egyptians who built the pyramids knew exactly how much material they needed and when?

Let’s learn how to do this while looking at an example of how one can allocate resources when planning a project (work planning).

Take a look at the example scenario in the Google sheet below. In it, our institution would like to open a City Hub in Cairo in the next 3 months. Study it carefully to see what resource considerations they might make.

Now that you have a solid grasp of work planning and its thought processes, it’s time to use those skills for your own benefit. To ensure your success over the next weeks, you will take all the skills that you have just learned and use them to complete your work plan and resource list. See, we kept our promise that we would come back to this activity. Let’s get started.

---

## Activity

For this activity, you are required to create a work plan for the next 5 to 6 weeks (or for as many weeks as you feel inspired to). The idea is to practice using a work plan while planning out your next few weeks, ensuring success. The second month of the program will be demanding, and we understand that you may have personal commitments to attend to as well. This is an opportune time to reflect on the most important tasks that you need to complete in the second month, whether related to the program or not and plan accordingly to tackle them.

You can use a Google Sheets work plan or a work plan app of your choice, however, it must have all the core elements. The outline of your work plan must have the following content:

- Your objective(s)
- Description/bucket
- Tasks/ action items/ key deliverables,
- Timelines (start and end date)
- Responsibility/owner
- Whatever else you think you need to function effectively.

As a refresher, here is an example of our **[work plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14kQfLicS7S1DxqdpdDMY_ixTvboRH7loA4s0_icDxWA/copy)**. Feel free to make it your own and tweak it up.

---

### Part A

 ==1 -== Start by defining an objective that aligns with your personal goals for the next 5 to 6 weeks. An example is “to complete and participate in all Foundations Month 2 activities before the respective deadlines”. Remember your objective must be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-based.

Now, using your own work plan do the following;

==2 -== List all deliverables/tasks/activities that you need to complete in the next five to six weeks.

==3 -== Estimate the task duration; start and end times for each task.

==4 -== Order your tasks in the chronological order they must be completed.

==5 -== Create your timeline (if it does not automatically get created when you enter the start and end dates).

==6 -== Add the status of each task.

==7 -== If you have tasks that you need someone else to do, and those tasks are crucial for your success in the upcoming weeks, make sure to add those tasks to your work plan list along with the name of the person who will be responsible for completing them.

---

### Part B

Now it’s time to look at your resources. Make a list of what you need and how you might allocate resources to achieve your objective.

1. What Equipment will you need (e.g. laptops)
2. What Material/other resources will you need (e.g. time, a quiet room)
3. Who’s help do you need (e.g. a peer, your squad)

And that’s it. You are done with planning ahead.

Once your Work Plan is complete, it is time to take a step further and share your Work Plan with 2 peers so you have them support you and hold you accountable. Let’s do this in the next peer activity.

##### 1. Peer Activity: Share Your Work Plan

mandatory

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/f5865018ddac73e42bb695b3b3a22299f74abaa4.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T175434Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=7a9ba15bc3ff015360a9fc35bce6502fcea6b1fd2fb6dd237e59508aad324d35)

For your second peer activity this week, please do the following exercise with 2 peers. It can be online or at your nearest City Hub. Each peer should have at least 20 minutes to share their work plans and receive peer feedback.

 ==1 -== Find 2 peers to work with.

==2 -== Start by writing down your 2 peers’ first and last names, so you can remember who they are.

==3 -== Share the overall objective of your work plan. A good end goal can be: _To participate in all month 2 project team activities, to complete my degree program with Honors, or to submit all my milestones, tests and peer evaluations on time._

==4 -== Share your work plan with both peers so they can review it.

==5 -== Take 5-10 minutes to explain and walk your peers through your work plan, explaining:

- Your work plan categories and task descriptions
- Your rationale behind each task’s timeline and responsible person
- The impact of a specific time not being met
- Protocols or parameters that will help you meet each timeline.

==6 -== Outline what support you might need from your peers.

==7 -== Ask for your peers’ feedback as to whether:

- Your task descriptions are clear and specific
- The timelines for each task are feasible
- There is a task/action item that you might have overlooked.
- There are additional steps that you can take to improve your work plan.

==8 -== When you are done, take time to review your peers’ work plans, participate in each of their walkthroughs and explanations, and share your feedback.

When sharing feedback remember to:

- Highlight positive aspects (“GLOWS”), then highlight improvement points (“GROWS”)
- Share practical steps your peer could take to improve their work plan.

### Great job! You are now done with this activity and are almost at the end.

Go through the following questions, and share you responses in your **[squad on eHub.](https://ehub.alxafrica.com/)**  

- Who are the 2 peers that you did your Peer Activity with? Write their full names below.
- What were some work plan GLOWS (positive attributes) that your peer shared with you?
- What were some work plan GROWS (areas of growth) that your peers shared with you?

# Week 4 Milestone Readiness

You’ve made it!  
That means it’s time for your weekly milestone.  

---

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![deadline icon](https://img.icons8.com/?size=100&id=din51tUld11B&format=png&color=000000)|The **deadline to submit** this milestone is the **Monday of Week 5 by 11:59 PM GMT**.|

The Week 4 Milestone **builds onto all the work you did** as part of your Week 2 and 3 Milestones over the last couple of weeks. You **will refer back** to your:

1. Mission statement
2. Chosen GCGO
3. Identified problem
4. “Why” for selecting it
5. Questions you asked
6. Completed web research

That is why it is of the **utmost importance** that you make use of your Week 2 and 3 Milestone Worksheets and your notes for the activities you completed in that week.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![high priority icon](https://img.icons8.com/?size=100&id=Vtv1Seexiz5k&format=png&color=000000)|**Remember!**  <br>Although you _do have the option_ to choose a different mission statement, GCGO, and/or problem than the ones you chose to use in Week 3, we _strongly advise against_ this, as you would then need to re-do all the Week 2 and 3 Milestone activities before coming back to your Week 4 Milestone. That means doing all the problem scoping, questioning, and research work again!<br><br>---<br><br>If you _do_ decide to use a different GCGO and/or problem for your Week 4 Milestone, you will _need to redo_ all the Week 3 problem scoping, questioning, and research work. BUT you dot NOT need to resubmit your Week 3 Milestone or Test!|

Considering the **time limitation** and **amount of work** involved, we _strongly recommend_ that you **work with the same mission statement** as your Week 2 Milestone, and **the same GCGO and problem** that you used for your Week 3 Milestone as your basis.

---

### Preparing to Complete Milestone 4

In preparation for your Week 4 Milestone you will **use the ==skills that you acquired== in Weeks 2 and 3** to prepare a **Google Slides presentation**.

- You will begin by making a copy of this **[Week 4 Milestone Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwnVa2CGnI6M_ADd8Nx2A3WB8hNI2AxO63PGoTT6qgo/copy)**
- You will then use this completed worksheet to create your final presentation.

Your presentation must be **a showcase** of the following:

1. Your personal mission statement (from your Week 2 Milestone).
2. Your chosen GCGO, and an explanation as to why it matters (from your Week 3 Milestone).
3. A clearly defined problem related to your chosen GCGO (from your Week 3 Milestone).
4. Your research questions and hypotheses (from your Week 3 Milestone).
5. Its impact on a specific target audience (#UserPersonas).
6. Components of your problem-solving framework.
7. A solution and action steps.
8. Source references and citations throughout.

This presentation will contain **information _based on_ your work and relevant notes** from both the Week 2 and 3 Milestone Worksheets you have already completed, and the activities you will be completing this week. If you’ve gone through the content, you will already have been introduced to the details of how to go about doing the presentation.

Please **use the output of your work** in these research activities **for your Week 4 Milestone assignment**. For instructions on how to submit your assignment, please **go the next page**.
