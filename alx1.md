### Welcome to Week 4, Learners!

This is the final week in “Phase 1” of this course!

If you’re feeling what we felt after Week 3, you’ll know we’re right in the nitty-gritty and meaty part of the learning journey!

### Last week

You donned your Sherlock Holmes cap and mastered the art of problem definition, problem-solving approaches, and asking the right questions for gathering information.

### This week

We’ll pick up right where we left off. You put in some serious effort and hard work last week, and now it’s time to harness and transform it all into a compelling story. This week we will provide you with the tools and techniques to conduct research and use your findings to craft a narrative—and presentation—that captivates and leaves a lasting impact on your audience. This week will take your storytelling skills to the next level! Remember, there is another milestone to submit this week, and we will give you sneak peak into what is in it in the next few pages.

To give you a sneak peek of what’s in store, we have provided a video that offers an overview of the week ahead. While watching it, pay close attention to the following key points:

- Milestone and Weekly Test Reminders
- Week 4 learning focus (building upon the foundations laid in Week 3)
- The 2 peer activities
- Guidelines for **Week 4 Milestone**
- Submission deadline for both **Week 4 Milestone** and **Week 4 Test**
Professional Foundations - Week 4 Overview
Video Transcript

Hi everyone, it’s me, your facilitator, Muhammad Khisal! Welcome to Week 4. The days are really cruising by, and it’s officially almost the end of Phase 1! A big congratulations to you for successfully completing all the work in Week 3! You really are making great progress!

We know that Week 3 was very full and may have tested your limits, but we are confident in what you can achieve. The ALX Professional Foundations team believes we “Do Hard Things” and refuses to settle for the ordinary. So, well done for tackling Week 3 and building the habits and skills that will set you up for success for a long time to come. You are making a huge investment in yourself, and we take our hats off to you for staying committed to your growth. 

Last week, we challenged you to incorporate Morning Pages into your daily routine. If you had a mic drop moment and successfully completed the challenge to practice Morning Pages every day for 7 days straight, you earned your bragging rights. We celebrate you and give you full permission to flex a little in your squads on the eHub.  

If you did not complete the challenge, or maybe just managed to write on some days, we encourage you to reflect on the reasons for not being able to complete the challenge and whether there is something you can do differently to incorporate Morning Pages into your everyday routine this week. The benefits of practicing Morning Pages really speak for themselves, and we want everyone to experience them.

Before we discuss Week 4, I have a few important requests and reminders. If you have any milestones or tests that you have not submitted or passed, please do so as soon as possible. Remember! To pass the course, you must:
Pass all Weekly Tests with a minimum score of 70%.
Submit all Weekly Milestones on time.
Complete and pass all End of Module Quizzes.
If you are behind with any of these, please catch up before the end of Phase 1. In this way you will ensure that you can easily keep up and continue your journey with us.

OK, we’re really excited about this week! Let’s dive into where your learning experience will take you in Week 4. Last week, you spent time learning how to define and scope a problem, and you engaged with 2 problem-solving approaches: The McKinsey Method and the Cool Head, Warm Heart Method. You practiced asking the right questions and developed 3 research questions and a hypothesis.

This week, you will continue the hard work you did in Week 3 by deepening the skills you need to define the scope of the problem further, tell compelling stories, and create the perfect slide deck.

This week you will:
Continue to incorporate healthy habits into your routine and start practicing the last tool in the Daily 3, which is Meditation.
Practice using AI tools for web research and draft a mini-research report.
Review problem definition, and refine your own problem definition from Week 3.
Strengthen your communication skills with some writing foundations, including storytelling and technical writing.
Boost your storytelling abilities.
Learn how to communicate better with tech teams.
Get organized with work-planning practices, techniques, and tools.
Get a glimpse of the opportunities that exist due to technology. 
Explore the impact of AI.

You’ll also have 2 content-related activities this week:
For the first activity, you will write a 400-500 word story and find at least 2 peers with whom to have fun storytelling. You can carry out this activity with your peers online or at your City Hub if you are close to one. The storytelling activity will require at least one hour of your time. 
The second peer activity will focus on your completed work plan. This is an essential element of your learning journey as you prepare for Phase 2’s lessons and your team project. Again, you will need to collaborate with at least 2 peers and set aside 1 hour to complete this activity online or at your nearest City Hub. 

This week's learning content on Savanna provides more information on both of these activities. Please make sure that you give yourself enough time to do the work with your peers. 

The Week 4 Milestone and Week 4 Test are due by the end of this week. The Week 4 Test is an automatically graded quiz that you will take here on Savanna. The list of topics covered in this test appears in the next few pages.

The Week 4 Milestone is a completed Milestone Worksheet .pdf submission. You will fill out the Milestone Worksheet using the information from the Google slide deck you created as part of the assessment. Your slide deck will be a cumulation of the work you complete throughout the week, namely:
Your chosen GCGO and why it matters.
A clearly defined problem based on a GCGO.
Its impact on a specific target audience (#UserPersonas).
Components of your problem-solving framework.
Your solution and action steps. 
References and citations.

We have provided clear step-by-step instructions on the Week 4 Milestone pages.  

We hope that you’ll find this week to be engaging and rewarding. As a master of your own learning journey, think ahead and allocate your time, energy, and focus accordingly. There is a lot of content to cover and new skills to acquire, so start early and work at it every day.

To grow, one has to push limits. We are confident in your ability to tackle this week like the young leader you are. We know you did not come here expecting the ordinary. So buckle up, dig deep for that energy, and let’s do this! 

All the best with Week 4!


# Daily 3: Meditation

This week you will be adding the 3rd habit of the Daily 3 to your habits: Meditation!

**Mindfulness meditation** is simply the practice of relaxing the body and focusing one’s attention (on your breath or an object of your choice) to gain greater awareness of one’s thoughts and feelings.

So why should you meditate? This short 2-minute video offers several reasons. As you’re watching, ask yourself:

During Week 1, we discussed the powerful benefits of meditation. It can help with reducing negativity, stress, and anxiety, while also boosting positivity, focus, concentration, and overall well-being. Studies have shown its effectiveness.

Learning to meditate is like learning any other new skill. If you’re just starting, it will likely feel like exercising a muscle that you’ve never really worked out before. It will take consistent practice to get comfortable. So be patient with yourself and give yourself the opportunity to try it multiple times.

  

This week, we will explore the basics of meditation and guide you through a simple practice to help you get started. Whether you’re new to meditation or have been practicing for years, **we challenge you to 7 days of daily 5-minute meditation practice.** We invite you to notice what effect it has on you!

You might be thinking “I don’t have the time for this.” Well, did you know that **even 1 minute of mindfulness meditation has measurable benefits?** Numerous studies and testimonials demonstrate the marked benefits of meditation and mindfulness practices. We will share one such testimonial in the next few pages.

We hope you will develop a new habit with this ancient practice and enjoy its many benefits.

Read the following supplementary article to learn more about how meditation can benefit your wellbeing as well as performance in professional and academic tasks.

Take a moment to reflect on your ==Daily 3 activities.== How have they helped you stay focused and productive throughout the weeks? Share your reflections with your peers and inspire others to stick to their Daily 3 goals.
# Meditation: Challenge

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T094536Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=9b1e2784b368d9d1059ca010d9c3cd843a196c3067051379688d0ad786df9f5a)

  
**Our challenge for you this week is to incorporate Meditation into your daily routine.**

This is in addition to your Daily 3 practices of Movement and Morning Pages. The three habits have immense benefits, so it is important to build and stick to each one.

**So, for your challenge this week, here is what you need to do:**

- Follow **[this link](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=shot+medidation+for+college+students)** to a list of 5-minute meditation videos for students or you can download a meditation app on your phone. Our favourite apps are:
    - **[Waking Up](https://www.wakingup.com/tim)**
    - **[Calm](https://www.calm.com/)**
    - **[Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app)**
- Pick a meditation that speaks to you so you can use it this week. We recommend picking one and sticking to it a few times. That way you build familiarity with it.
- Decide on a time you will meditate every day and stick to it.
- Get comfortable, play your chosen video and follow along.
- Do this for 7 days straight!

You can choose to meditate without the video-guided meditation, but if you are new at this, the videos are the perfect companion to help along. Here is one short video that we like from the list above. You are welcome to follow along.

At the beginning of Month 2, we will ask you to honestly share one or two things that changed in your day-to-day life from practising meditation. We are curious people and want to know if taking a few moments each day to be mindful added any benefits.

## ranscript

- [Narrator] Hey there, and thanks

0:01

for gifting yourself these next few minutes.

0:04

It's important to remember that you're a priority,

0:07

and allowing yourself even just a few short minutes

0:09

of intentional reflection can really have

0:11

a positive impact on the rest of your day.

0:15

So let's use these next few minutes to come back to center

0:19

and set an intention for the rest of your day.

0:24

Move into a comfortable position,

0:26

whether you're seated at your desk at work

0:29

or laying on the couch at home, and gently close your eyes

0:33

and shift all of your attention

0:35

onto your breathing, taking slower, deeper breaths

0:40

than you've taken all day so far.

0:42

Taking a deep breath in through your nose

0:46

and slowly letting it out through your mouth.

0:52

And continuing to breathe that way,

0:54

feeling your lungs expand out as you inhale.

0:59

And contract back in as you exhale.

1:06

Tune into your body, noticing how it feels.

1:11

Noticing if there's anything that it's trying to tell you.

1:15

Notice any place of tension or tightness in your body

1:20

and give those areas permission to relax,

1:24

sending love into those areas.

1:28

Thank your body for taking such good care of you,

1:31

and let it know that it's okay to rest

1:33

and relax for these next few minutes.

1:42

You may notice that your mind starts to wander off.

1:45

That's okay.

1:46

That's natural.

1:49

Just notice it and bring your attention back to your body

1:52

using your breath as your anchor.

1:57

Try to picture one thing that's happened today

2:01

that's made you smile or made you thankful or appreciative

2:07

and just let that feeling fill you up for a moment.

2:11

Breathe that feeling in from the top of your head

2:13

to the tips of your toes

2:17

and allow yourself to smile, if that feels natural.

2:22

Now, focus on something that you can do today,

2:26

whether it's for yourself or for someone else

2:30

that will allow you to continue feeling this way.

2:34

It could be something as small

2:36

as deciding to go to bed early tonight

2:38

so that you have time to finally read that book

2:41

that's been on your bedside table.

2:44

Or the joy of getting dinner with a close friend.

2:48

What's one little thing you can plan for your day

2:50

to bring that intentional joy to it?

2:54

Now just focus on that for a few minutes.

2:58

Sit in that feeling of joy and peace.

3:02

(light music)

3:53

Now let's take a few more deep breaths together.

3:56

A deep breath in, feeling your lungs

3:59

expand out as you inhale,

4:02

and everything contract back in as you exhale.

4:09

Again, an even deeper breath than the one before it.

4:13

Holding that breath for a beat.

4:15

And exhaling everything out.

4:23

Last time, your deepest breath yet,

4:24

sending that breath through your entire body.

4:31

And exhale it out, and in your own time

4:34

slowly bring your awareness back to where you are

4:38

and thank yourself for taking these few minutes

4:40

to just be intentional and kind to yourself.

4:45

And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes

4:50

and enjoy the rest of your day.

4:52

(gentle piano music)

# king the Right Questions Review

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T095441Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=2e3c6d08c66f1a44ace9c308dd0d1f1632d61799be7481a4a94c2c19410ade44)

  

The other half of last week’s Milestone required you to formulate 3 research questions and a hypothesis. If you recall, we had a deep dive into the importance of asking effective questions that will inform your research. After all, problem-solving is all about asking the right questions.

==Do you remember how to check whether your questions are effective?==

Here is the recap: You can ask yourself more questions like:

- Does my question capture a complex issue or problem related to my chosen GCGO?
- Is my question nuanced, with no particular right or wrong answer or easy response?
- Is my question relevant to what is happening in the field?
- Do multiple stakeholders care about the answer to this question?
- Will I need to do more work to learn more about the factors affecting and influencing this question?

**Do you also remember the components of a good research question and the three different types of research questions?**

If you do, well done! Your work this week will revolve around research questions, so if you need a memory boost, take a moment now to refer back to the **[Research Questions](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/107824)** page from last week.

==Now, as a final step before we dive into all things research==

Take a moment to review your problem statement, 3 research questions, and hypotheses that you submitted as part of your Milestone 3 Worksheet. As you review, reflect on these two questions:

- What are the main things I’ve learned about the process of defining problems?
- From the top of my head, what are the most important key elements to ask effective questions?
# Research Methodology

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T095536Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=dfe07deb15c7a88dd340b2462b03a4b92c81772be0877c9892205c8f6f1d9d26)

  

Planning your research requires key steps that allow you to maximize your time and effort as much as possible. Below are some high-level steps to follow as you begin your research process:

1. ==Define your objectives, questions and hypotheses.== What are you trying to accomplish with this research? What do you wish to find out that will accelerate your work in the right direction?
2. ==Determine your end outputs.== What type of data/information is ideal for you to find, based on what you are trying to accomplish? Do you need to present it in any particular format?
3. ==Scope your main sources of information.== Do you already know where you might want to go to find the information you’re seeking? Are there particular entities or organizations that you know are seen as “experts” on the topic?
4. ==Begin gathering your required information.== What search terms should you use? How many reports/articles do you want to read before deciding you have seen enough?
5. ==Evaluate the validity/credibility of your sources and information.== From all of the information you’ve read or collected, which is most reliable? Are there any pieces of information that are validated across multiple sources? What about those that stand out / that are outliers? Which do you trust?
6. ==Synthesize and communicate your key findings.== What are the key takeaways that you want to share? How can you share them in such a way that provides the most impact?
7. ==Return to your original objectives and key questions== to ensure you have answered them appropriately. Have you found the answers you need or the direction you need to take?

---

Besides the above, it is also useful to remember that there will be times that you will _**NOT**_ have to go through an incredibly rigorous research process to find the answers you need. So, in addition to the steps above, it is also useful to determine whether any of the following approaches can help you instead:

- Discussions with internal experts: Is there anyone within your organization who might have the intel you’re seeking?
- Internal materials: Are there any existing materials in the organization that might provide a quick path to the answers you’re searching for?
- Government mandates: Are there any policies or regulations that dictate the right pathway to take?

So now let’s go back to the 3 research questions that you crafted as part of your Week 3 Milestone. It’s time to take these questions several steps further, do some research, and test each of your hypotheses.

==Here is what you need to do to complete this activity:==

1. Have your completed Milestone 3 worksheet open so you can easily reference your Problem Statement, research questions, and hypotheses.
2. We have created a worksheet that you can use to organize and plan your research. Open the **[research worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D34H8Nc_rOSmmk2gZNDgY16gmssMZtaQnL-wHCRc02A/copy)**, and create a personal copy.
3. You will go through the Research Methodology steps you have just learned, and assess how you plan to approach your web research for your 3 research questions from your completed Milestone 3 worksheet.
4. **Only complete Part 1** of the worksheet.

Later, you will complete Part 2 of the worksheet and use your findings to build a mini-research report.

_(We hope that you are saving all these resources we are sharing in a specific ALX Professional Foundations Program Folder on Drive. If you haven’t been doing so, now is a good time to stop and get organized. It will be super helpful when you have to review something later, whether in this program or your professional life.)_

2:17

and there's 12 instances of the word

2:21

discrimination

2:22

right one two three four five six seven

2:25

eight nine ten eleven twelve

2:27

so let's go okay the first ones here the

2:30

second one's here

2:31

third one's here let's see if there's

2:34

anything down here all right so

2:36

let's look at this sentence here it says

2:39

the indigenous

2:40

indian population continues to face

2:42

systematic discrimination

2:45

so indian population in mexico that's

2:47

interesting huh

2:49

okay um indigenous indians right so

2:52

native

2:53

mexicans just like we have native

2:55

americans

2:56

let's look for the next word

2:58

discrimination

3:01

okay here we go in addition indians

3:03

inability to speak spanish means that

3:06

they face

3:06

widespread employment discrimination in

3:09

spanish-speaking areas

3:11

in mexico okay 40 percent of the migrant

3:15

farm workers

3:16

are indian they have low income jobs

3:19

okay so that's another interesting fact

3:23

right um so let me copy this sentence

3:27

right

3:27

these are some good sentences i'm going

3:31

to

3:32

command c or i'm going to do this right

3:35

and go to my microsoft word okay

3:38

i'm going to make some spaces i'm going

3:39

to copy that sentence remember i'm not

3:42

putting this in my essay i'm not

3:43

plagiarizing this sentence i'm just

3:47

putting it here so i can see it later

3:49

right because i don't want to read

3:50

through the whole article

3:52

okay i'm going to continue to go through

3:54

okay

3:55

here's another one oh interesting

3:57

indigenous women suffer

3:59

many instances of double discrimination

4:01

the illiteracy rate

4:03

among women is 20 percent indigenous

4:05

women is 20

4:07

um so sexual assault and rape

4:10

and things like that so this paragraph

4:13

is about discrimination against women so

4:15

this

4:15

seems like a useful paragraph

4:19

for my research i'm going to copy it

4:21

into microsoft word

4:24

okay and let's just continue keep going

4:27

down here

4:28

all right and this is saying what the

4:32

government is

4:32

doing the government says that racial

4:35

discrimination does not exist in mexico

4:37

what so this

4:40

tells what the government is doing about

4:42

it and it sounds like they're not really

4:43

doing anything about it

4:45

so i'm going to paste that in because

4:47

that could be a nice

4:48

part of my paper what is the government

4:50

doing about discrimination in mexico

4:53

and what is the government in korea

4:54

doing about discrimination

4:56

in korea so remember i just took out a

4:59

few little tiny facts i didn't read the

5:01

whole article but maybe i should go back

5:03

and i should read there's probably some

5:04

other useful information here

5:08

56 ethnic and indigenous groups in

5:11

mexico

5:12

interesting that could be very useful

5:14

for my research as well

5:15

i'm going to put that up here in

5:18

microsoft word

5:19

so okay now

5:22

um the last step is

5:26

i want to i want to save this website

5:28

i'm going to go to microsoft word

5:30

i'm going to paste the url so i know

5:32

where i found this information

5:34

and let's just summarize this in our own

5:37

words

5:38

okay

5:41

so uh we have

5:45

fifth uh we have the url we have 56

5:48

ethnic and indigenous groups

5:50

okay we have

5:54

we know we learned that indians

6:01

who can't speak spanish

6:06

there is discrimination against

6:09

indians who can't speak spanish um

6:13

low income jobs

6:16

and then we have 40 percent are

6:20

migrant farm workers according to this

6:23

paragraph

6:24

so i just summarized that paragraph so

6:26

i'm done

6:28

next paragraph let's look let's

6:29

summarize this paragraph just what are

6:32

the important facts here we have

6:35

indigenous women

6:38

have i spelled that wrong i don't really

6:41

care let's just auto correct that

6:44

double discrimination okay and we have

6:48

things like

6:48

illiteracy the inability to read

6:51

we have um rape and sexual assault

6:55

in the military okay rape

6:58

sexual assault military

7:03

and

7:03

[Music]

7:07

justice is not administered fairly after

7:09

women report abuse

7:11

the outcome is often heavily in favor of

7:13

the male defendants

7:14

so justice system

7:18

does not basically does not listen to

7:21

women's cases okay

7:25

so that's pretty much everything from

7:26

that paragraph i need delete it

7:29

okay last part um

7:32

okay the government still maintains that

7:35

racial discrimination does not exist

7:37

that's very important okay government

7:41

we'll say mexican government says

7:44

racism does not exist

7:48

it's basically what it's saying right

7:53

it contends that racial discrimination

7:54

is not the cause of poverty

7:56

but poverty is the cause of

7:58

discrimination

8:00

so that's an interesting quote there all

8:02

right

8:03

let's copy that up cut it whatever

8:07

mexican the government says racism does

8:10

not exist

8:11

it states that and i'm going to put

8:14

quotes because i copied it directly

8:17

remember if you copy something directly

8:18

you put quotes and that's everything

8:20

from that paragraph

8:22

so this information here

8:26

is the information i'm going to put in

8:27

my essay

8:29

notice i just took this really big long

8:31

article

8:32

i searched for discrimination i

8:35

copied and pasted in here and then i

8:37

summarized it in my own words

8:38

and now i have information for my

8:40

article okay so that's the process you

8:43

go through

8:43

to find take out information from

8:46

an article that you find for your

8:52

research
