### Welcome to Week 4, Learners!

This is the final week in “Phase 1” of this course!

If you’re feeling what we felt after Week 3, you’ll know we’re right in the nitty-gritty and meaty part of the learning journey!

### Last week

You donned your Sherlock Holmes cap and mastered the art of problem definition, problem-solving approaches, and asking the right questions for gathering information.

### This week

We’ll pick up right where we left off. You put in some serious effort and hard work last week, and now it’s time to harness and transform it all into a compelling story. This week we will provide you with the tools and techniques to conduct research and use your findings to craft a narrative—and presentation—that captivates and leaves a lasting impact on your audience. This week will take your storytelling skills to the next level! Remember, there is another milestone to submit this week, and we will give you sneak peak into what is in it in the next few pages.

To give you a sneak peek of what’s in store, we have provided a video that offers an overview of the week ahead. While watching it, pay close attention to the following key points:

- Milestone and Weekly Test Reminders
- Week 4 learning focus (building upon the foundations laid in Week 3)
- The 2 peer activities
- Guidelines for **Week 4 Milestone**
- Submission deadline for both **Week 4 Milestone** and **Week 4 Test**
Professional Foundations - Week 4 Overview
Video Transcript

Hi everyone, it’s me, your facilitator, Muhammad Khisal! Welcome to Week 4. The days are really cruising by, and it’s officially almost the end of Phase 1! A big congratulations to you for successfully completing all the work in Week 3! You really are making great progress!

We know that Week 3 was very full and may have tested your limits, but we are confident in what you can achieve. The ALX Professional Foundations team believes we “Do Hard Things” and refuses to settle for the ordinary. So, well done for tackling Week 3 and building the habits and skills that will set you up for success for a long time to come. You are making a huge investment in yourself, and we take our hats off to you for staying committed to your growth. 

Last week, we challenged you to incorporate Morning Pages into your daily routine. If you had a mic drop moment and successfully completed the challenge to practice Morning Pages every day for 7 days straight, you earned your bragging rights. We celebrate you and give you full permission to flex a little in your squads on the eHub.  

If you did not complete the challenge, or maybe just managed to write on some days, we encourage you to reflect on the reasons for not being able to complete the challenge and whether there is something you can do differently to incorporate Morning Pages into your everyday routine this week. The benefits of practicing Morning Pages really speak for themselves, and we want everyone to experience them.

Before we discuss Week 4, I have a few important requests and reminders. If you have any milestones or tests that you have not submitted or passed, please do so as soon as possible. Remember! To pass the course, you must:
Pass all Weekly Tests with a minimum score of 70%.
Submit all Weekly Milestones on time.
Complete and pass all End of Module Quizzes.
If you are behind with any of these, please catch up before the end of Phase 1. In this way you will ensure that you can easily keep up and continue your journey with us.

OK, we’re really excited about this week! Let’s dive into where your learning experience will take you in Week 4. Last week, you spent time learning how to define and scope a problem, and you engaged with 2 problem-solving approaches: The McKinsey Method and the Cool Head, Warm Heart Method. You practiced asking the right questions and developed 3 research questions and a hypothesis.

This week, you will continue the hard work you did in Week 3 by deepening the skills you need to define the scope of the problem further, tell compelling stories, and create the perfect slide deck.

This week you will:
Continue to incorporate healthy habits into your routine and start practicing the last tool in the Daily 3, which is Meditation.
Practice using AI tools for web research and draft a mini-research report.
Review problem definition, and refine your own problem definition from Week 3.
Strengthen your communication skills with some writing foundations, including storytelling and technical writing.
Boost your storytelling abilities.
Learn how to communicate better with tech teams.
Get organized with work-planning practices, techniques, and tools.
Get a glimpse of the opportunities that exist due to technology. 
Explore the impact of AI.

You’ll also have 2 content-related activities this week:
For the first activity, you will write a 400-500 word story and find at least 2 peers with whom to have fun storytelling. You can carry out this activity with your peers online or at your City Hub if you are close to one. The storytelling activity will require at least one hour of your time. 
The second peer activity will focus on your completed work plan. This is an essential element of your learning journey as you prepare for Phase 2’s lessons and your team project. Again, you will need to collaborate with at least 2 peers and set aside 1 hour to complete this activity online or at your nearest City Hub. 

This week's learning content on Savanna provides more information on both of these activities. Please make sure that you give yourself enough time to do the work with your peers. 

The Week 4 Milestone and Week 4 Test are due by the end of this week. The Week 4 Test is an automatically graded quiz that you will take here on Savanna. The list of topics covered in this test appears in the next few pages.

The Week 4 Milestone is a completed Milestone Worksheet .pdf submission. You will fill out the Milestone Worksheet using the information from the Google slide deck you created as part of the assessment. Your slide deck will be a cumulation of the work you complete throughout the week, namely:
Your chosen GCGO and why it matters.
A clearly defined problem based on a GCGO.
Its impact on a specific target audience (#UserPersonas).
Components of your problem-solving framework.
Your solution and action steps. 
References and citations.

We have provided clear step-by-step instructions on the Week 4 Milestone pages.  

We hope that you’ll find this week to be engaging and rewarding. As a master of your own learning journey, think ahead and allocate your time, energy, and focus accordingly. There is a lot of content to cover and new skills to acquire, so start early and work at it every day.

To grow, one has to push limits. We are confident in your ability to tackle this week like the young leader you are. We know you did not come here expecting the ordinary. So buckle up, dig deep for that energy, and let’s do this! 

All the best with Week 4!


# Daily 3: Meditation

This week you will be adding the 3rd habit of the Daily 3 to your habits: Meditation!

**Mindfulness meditation** is simply the practice of relaxing the body and focusing one’s attention (on your breath or an object of your choice) to gain greater awareness of one’s thoughts and feelings.

So why should you meditate? This short 2-minute video offers several reasons. As you’re watching, ask yourself:

During Week 1, we discussed the powerful benefits of meditation. It can help with reducing negativity, stress, and anxiety, while also boosting positivity, focus, concentration, and overall well-being. Studies have shown its effectiveness.

Learning to meditate is like learning any other new skill. If you’re just starting, it will likely feel like exercising a muscle that you’ve never really worked out before. It will take consistent practice to get comfortable. So be patient with yourself and give yourself the opportunity to try it multiple times.

  

This week, we will explore the basics of meditation and guide you through a simple practice to help you get started. Whether you’re new to meditation or have been practicing for years, **we challenge you to 7 days of daily 5-minute meditation practice.** We invite you to notice what effect it has on you!

You might be thinking “I don’t have the time for this.” Well, did you know that **even 1 minute of mindfulness meditation has measurable benefits?** Numerous studies and testimonials demonstrate the marked benefits of meditation and mindfulness practices. We will share one such testimonial in the next few pages.

We hope you will develop a new habit with this ancient practice and enjoy its many benefits.

Read the following supplementary article to learn more about how meditation can benefit your wellbeing as well as performance in professional and academic tasks.

Take a moment to reflect on your ==Daily 3 activities.== How have they helped you stay focused and productive throughout the weeks? Share your reflections with your peers and inspire others to stick to their Daily 3 goals.
# Meditation: Challenge

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T094536Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=9b1e2784b368d9d1059ca010d9c3cd843a196c3067051379688d0ad786df9f5a)

  
**Our challenge for you this week is to incorporate Meditation into your daily routine.**

This is in addition to your Daily 3 practices of Movement and Morning Pages. The three habits have immense benefits, so it is important to build and stick to each one.

**So, for your challenge this week, here is what you need to do:**

- Follow **[this link](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=shot+medidation+for+college+students)** to a list of 5-minute meditation videos for students or you can download a meditation app on your phone. Our favourite apps are:
    - **[Waking Up](https://www.wakingup.com/tim)**
    - **[Calm](https://www.calm.com/)**
    - **[Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app)**
- Pick a meditation that speaks to you so you can use it this week. We recommend picking one and sticking to it a few times. That way you build familiarity with it.
- Decide on a time you will meditate every day and stick to it.
- Get comfortable, play your chosen video and follow along.
- Do this for 7 days straight!

You can choose to meditate without the video-guided meditation, but if you are new at this, the videos are the perfect companion to help along. Here is one short video that we like from the list above. You are welcome to follow along.

At the beginning of Month 2, we will ask you to honestly share one or two things that changed in your day-to-day life from practising meditation. We are curious people and want to know if taking a few moments each day to be mindful added any benefits.

## ranscript

- [Narrator] Hey there, and thanks

0:01

for gifting yourself these next few minutes.

0:04

It's important to remember that you're a priority,

0:07

and allowing yourself even just a few short minutes

0:09

of intentional reflection can really have

0:11

a positive impact on the rest of your day.

0:15

So let's use these next few minutes to come back to center

0:19

and set an intention for the rest of your day.

0:24

Move into a comfortable position,

0:26

whether you're seated at your desk at work

0:29

or laying on the couch at home, and gently close your eyes

0:33

and shift all of your attention

0:35

onto your breathing, taking slower, deeper breaths

0:40

than you've taken all day so far.

0:42

Taking a deep breath in through your nose

0:46

and slowly letting it out through your mouth.

0:52

And continuing to breathe that way,

0:54

feeling your lungs expand out as you inhale.

0:59

And contract back in as you exhale.

1:06

Tune into your body, noticing how it feels.

1:11

Noticing if there's anything that it's trying to tell you.

1:15

Notice any place of tension or tightness in your body

1:20

and give those areas permission to relax,

1:24

sending love into those areas.

1:28

Thank your body for taking such good care of you,

1:31

and let it know that it's okay to rest

1:33

and relax for these next few minutes.

1:42

You may notice that your mind starts to wander off.

1:45

That's okay.

1:46

That's natural.

1:49

Just notice it and bring your attention back to your body

1:52

using your breath as your anchor.

1:57

Try to picture one thing that's happened today

2:01

that's made you smile or made you thankful or appreciative

2:07

and just let that feeling fill you up for a moment.

2:11

Breathe that feeling in from the top of your head

2:13

to the tips of your toes

2:17

and allow yourself to smile, if that feels natural.

2:22

Now, focus on something that you can do today,

2:26

whether it's for yourself or for someone else

2:30

that will allow you to continue feeling this way.

2:34

It could be something as small

2:36

as deciding to go to bed early tonight

2:38

so that you have time to finally read that book

2:41

that's been on your bedside table.

2:44

Or the joy of getting dinner with a close friend.

2:48

What's one little thing you can plan for your day

2:50

to bring that intentional joy to it?

2:54

Now just focus on that for a few minutes.

2:58

Sit in that feeling of joy and peace.

3:02

(light music)

3:53

Now let's take a few more deep breaths together.

3:56

A deep breath in, feeling your lungs

3:59

expand out as you inhale,

4:02

and everything contract back in as you exhale.

4:09

Again, an even deeper breath than the one before it.

4:13

Holding that breath for a beat.

4:15

And exhaling everything out.

4:23

Last time, your deepest breath yet,

4:24

sending that breath through your entire body.

4:31

And exhale it out, and in your own time

4:34

slowly bring your awareness back to where you are

4:38

and thank yourself for taking these few minutes

4:40

to just be intentional and kind to yourself.

4:45

And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes

4:50

and enjoy the rest of your day.

4:52

(gentle piano music)

# king the Right Questions Review

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T095441Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=2e3c6d08c66f1a44ace9c308dd0d1f1632d61799be7481a4a94c2c19410ade44)

  

The other half of last week’s Milestone required you to formulate 3 research questions and a hypothesis. If you recall, we had a deep dive into the importance of asking effective questions that will inform your research. After all, problem-solving is all about asking the right questions.

==Do you remember how to check whether your questions are effective?==

Here is the recap: You can ask yourself more questions like:

- Does my question capture a complex issue or problem related to my chosen GCGO?
- Is my question nuanced, with no particular right or wrong answer or easy response?
- Is my question relevant to what is happening in the field?
- Do multiple stakeholders care about the answer to this question?
- Will I need to do more work to learn more about the factors affecting and influencing this question?

**Do you also remember the components of a good research question and the three different types of research questions?**

If you do, well done! Your work this week will revolve around research questions, so if you need a memory boost, take a moment now to refer back to the **[Research Questions](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/107824)** page from last week.

==Now, as a final step before we dive into all things research==

Take a moment to review your problem statement, 3 research questions, and hypotheses that you submitted as part of your Milestone 3 Worksheet. As you review, reflect on these two questions:

- What are the main things I’ve learned about the process of defining problems?
- From the top of my head, what are the most important key elements to ask effective questions?
# Research Methodology

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T095536Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=dfe07deb15c7a88dd340b2462b03a4b92c81772be0877c9892205c8f6f1d9d26)

  

Planning your research requires key steps that allow you to maximize your time and effort as much as possible. Below are some high-level steps to follow as you begin your research process:

1. ==Define your objectives, questions and hypotheses.== What are you trying to accomplish with this research? What do you wish to find out that will accelerate your work in the right direction?
2. ==Determine your end outputs.== What type of data/information is ideal for you to find, based on what you are trying to accomplish? Do you need to present it in any particular format?
3. ==Scope your main sources of information.== Do you already know where you might want to go to find the information you’re seeking? Are there particular entities or organizations that you know are seen as “experts” on the topic?
4. ==Begin gathering your required information.== What search terms should you use? How many reports/articles do you want to read before deciding you have seen enough?
5. ==Evaluate the validity/credibility of your sources and information.== From all of the information you’ve read or collected, which is most reliable? Are there any pieces of information that are validated across multiple sources? What about those that stand out / that are outliers? Which do you trust?
6. ==Synthesize and communicate your key findings.== What are the key takeaways that you want to share? How can you share them in such a way that provides the most impact?
7. ==Return to your original objectives and key questions== to ensure you have answered them appropriately. Have you found the answers you need or the direction you need to take?

---

Besides the above, it is also useful to remember that there will be times that you will _**NOT**_ have to go through an incredibly rigorous research process to find the answers you need. So, in addition to the steps above, it is also useful to determine whether any of the following approaches can help you instead:

- Discussions with internal experts: Is there anyone within your organization who might have the intel you’re seeking?
- Internal materials: Are there any existing materials in the organization that might provide a quick path to the answers you’re searching for?
- Government mandates: Are there any policies or regulations that dictate the right pathway to take?

So now let’s go back to the 3 research questions that you crafted as part of your Week 3 Milestone. It’s time to take these questions several steps further, do some research, and test each of your hypotheses.

==Here is what you need to do to complete this activity:==

1. Have your completed Milestone 3 worksheet open so you can easily reference your Problem Statement, research questions, and hypotheses.
2. We have created a worksheet that you can use to organize and plan your research. Open the **[research worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D34H8Nc_rOSmmk2gZNDgY16gmssMZtaQnL-wHCRc02A/copy)**, and create a personal copy.
3. You will go through the Research Methodology steps you have just learned, and assess how you plan to approach your web research for your 3 research questions from your completed Milestone 3 worksheet.
4. **Only complete Part 1** of the worksheet.

Later, you will complete Part 2 of the worksheet and use your findings to build a mini-research report.

_(We hope that you are saving all these resources we are sharing in a specific ALX Professional Foundations Program Folder on Drive. If you haven’t been doing so, now is a good time to stop and get organized. It will be super helpful when you have to review something later, whether in this program or your professional life.)_

1:53

by searching for the word discrimination

1:55

so i have a mac computer so i'm going to

1:57

press command

1:58

f if you have a windows computer you

2:01

press ctrl

2:11

the search bar appears i'm going to type

2:13

in the word

2:15

discrimination

2:17

and there's 12 instances of the word

2:21

discrimination

2:22

right one two three four five six seven

2:25

eight nine ten eleven twelve

2:27

so let's go okay the first ones here the

2:30

second one's here

2:31

third one's here let's see if there's

2:34

anything down here all right so

2:36

let's look at this sentence here it says

2:39

the indigenous

2:40

indian population continues to face

2:42

systematic discrimination

2:45

so indian population in mexico that's

2:47

interesting huh

2:49

okay um indigenous indians right so

2:52

native

2:53

mexicans just like we have native

2:55

americans

2:56

let's look for the next word

2:58

discrimination

3:01

okay here we go in addition indians

3:03

inability to speak spanish means that

3:06

they face

3:06

widespread employment discrimination in

3:09

spanish-speaking areas

3:11

in mexico okay 40 percent of the migrant

3:15

farm workers

3:16

are indian they have low income jobs

3:19

okay so that's another interesting fact

3:23

right um so let me copy this sentence

3:27

right

3:27

these are some good sentences i'm going

3:31

to

3:32

command c or i'm going to do this right

3:35

and go to my microsoft word okay

3:38

i'm going to make some spaces i'm going

3:39

to copy that sentence remember i'm not

3:42

putting this in my essay i'm not

3:43

plagiarizing this sentence i'm just

3:47

putting it here so i can see it later

3:49

right because i don't want to read

3:50

through the whole article

3:52

okay i'm going to continue to go through

3:54

okay

3:55

here's another one oh interesting

3:57

indigenous women suffer

3:59

many instances of double discrimination

4:01

the illiteracy rate

4:03

among women is 20 percent indigenous

4:05

women is 20

4:07

um so sexual assault and rape

4:10

and things like that so this paragraph

4:13

is about discrimination against women so

4:15

this

4:15

seems like a useful paragraph

4:19

for my research i'm going to copy it

4:21

into microsoft word

4:24

okay and let's just continue keep going

4:27

down here

4:28

all right and this is saying what the

4:32

government is

4:32

doing the government says that racial

4:35

discrimination does not exist in mexico

4:37

what so this

4:40

tells what the government is doing about

4:42

it and it sounds like they're not really

4:43

doing anything about it

4:45

so i'm going to paste that in because

4:47

that could be a nice

4:48

part of my paper what is the government

4:50

doing about discrimination in mexico

4:53

and what is the government in korea

4:54

doing about discrimination

4:56

in korea so remember i just took out a

4:59

few little tiny facts i didn't read the

5:01

whole article but maybe i should go back

5:03

and i should read there's probably some

5:04

other useful information here

5:08

56 ethnic and indigenous groups in

5:11

mexico

5:12

interesting that could be very useful

5:14

for my research as well

5:15

i'm going to put that up here in

5:18

microsoft word

5:19

so okay now

5:22

um the last step is

5:26

i want to i want to save this website

5:28

i'm going to go to microsoft word

5:30

i'm going to paste the url so i know

5:32

where i found this information

5:34

and let's just summarize this in our own

5:37

words

5:38

okay

5:41

so uh we have

5:45

fifth uh we have the url we have 56

5:48

ethnic and indigenous groups

5:50

okay we have

5:54

we know we learned that indians

6:01

who can't speak spanish

6:06

there is discrimination against

6:09

indians who can't speak spanish um

6:13

low income jobs

6:16

and then we have 40 percent are

6:20

migrant farm workers according to this

6:23

paragraph

6:24

so i just summarized that paragraph so

6:26

i'm done

6:28

next paragraph let's look let's

6:29

summarize this paragraph just what are

6:32

the important facts here we have

6:35

indigenous women

6:38

have i spelled that wrong i don't really

6:41

care let's just auto correct that

6:44

double discrimination okay and we have

6:48

things like

6:48

illiteracy the inability to read

6:51

we have um rape and sexual assault

6:55

in the military okay rape

6:58

sexual assault military

7:03

and

7:03

[Music]

7:07

justice is not administered fairly after

7:09

women report abuse

7:11

the outcome is often heavily in favor of

7:13

the male defendants

7:14

so justice system

7:18

does not basically does not listen to

7:21

women's cases okay

7:25

so that's pretty much everything from

7:26

that paragraph i need delete it

7:29

okay last part um

7:32

okay the government still maintains that

7:35

racial discrimination does not exist

7:37

that's very important okay government

7:41

we'll say mexican government says

7:44

racism does not exist

7:48

it's basically what it's saying right

7:53

it contends that racial discrimination

7:54

is not the cause of poverty

7:56

but poverty is the cause of

7:58

discrimination

8:00

so that's an interesting quote there all

8:02

right

8:03

let's copy that up cut it whatever

8:07

mexican the government says racism does

8:10

not exist

8:11

it states that and i'm going to put

8:14

quotes because i copied it directly

8:17

remember if you copy something directly

8:18

you put quotes and that's everything

8:20

from that paragraph

8:22

so this information here

8:26

is the information i'm going to put in

8:27

my essay

8:29

notice i just took this really big long

8:31

article

8:32

i searched for discrimination i

8:35

copied and pasted in here and then i

8:37

summarized it in my own words

8:38

and now i have information for my

8:40

article okay so that's the process you

8:43

go through

8:43

to find take out information from

8:46

an article that you find for your

8:52

research
## Introduction

0:11

Evaluating sources is an important step in the research process. This tutorial explains criteria

0:17

you should use to evaulate sources, whether they are websites, library books, or articles from

0:23

library databases.

0:26

Use the acronym CRAP to remember the criteria you will use to evaluate sources.

## CRAP Acronym Explanation

0:32

The letters represent Currency, Reliability and Relevance, Authority and Audience, and

0:38

Purpose and Point of View.

0:43

Step 1. To evaluate a source for currency, look for the publication date. If you are researching a

## Currency Explanation and Example

0:50

current news topic, such as an upcoming election issue, timeliness is important.

0:57

If you are researching a subject such as a literary movement or history, a source that is

1:03

20 or more years old may be just as useful as a source published last year.

1:11

This book's record in the library catalog shows the publiction date after the name of the

1:16

publisher. Based on the subject and date, is this book still considered current?

## Relevance Explanation and Example

1:24

Step 2. When evaluating a source for relevance, look for terminology that reflects the focus of

1:31

your research. Determine if the source contains the information you need.

1:37

For example, using the book's record, look for subject headings that describe the item's focus.

1:47

A table of contents or summary of the item might be available to read.

## Reliability Explanation and Example

1:54

Step 3. Look for signs of the item's reliability. Are any references listed? If your source is a

2:01

website, are any links provided? What are the links?

2:05

Additionally, consider whether or not the source has a specific bias or slant of opinion.

2:13

Opinions are helpful if you want to construct a persuasive agrument. When you are looking for

2:17

hard facts, on the other hand, locate sources that are informative rather than persuasive.

2:24

This article has numerous links throughout its contents.

2:29

It also ends with references for additional sources.

## Authority Explanation and Example

2:35

Step 4. Determine the authority responsible for the source. Look for evidence that the author

2:42

or organization is a credible expert on the topic. Often you can find this information within the

2:48

publication itself.

2:52

Let's say that you've located an article by Deborah Tannen. If you conduct a quick search,

2:57

you will see that she is a professor at Georgetown University who has written many

3:01

books and articles about language and communication.

3:07

If you are using a website, look at the website's domain extension. Websites with .edu domains

3:13

are tied to academic institutions. United States government websites have a .gov domain.

3:20

Others to consider are .org for nonprofit organizations that may have a specific opinion

3:26

or agenda, .com for commercial organizations such as Amazon.com, and .net, which may be

3:33

a personal or local community website.

## Audience Explanation and Example

3:39

Step 5. No matter what type of source you are using, it is important to consider the target

3:45

audience. Is the information presented for the general public, for college students, or for

3:51

professionals in a specific trade or research field? Or, is it for an entirely different audience?

3:59

This particular website has sections for kids and for teenagers.

## Purpose and Point of View Explanation and Example

4:06

Step 6. Consideration of the author's purpose and point of view is also important in evaluating

4:13

a source. What is the author's or organization's goal in publishing the information?

4:19

Is the goal to present facts, sell a product, or persuade an audience?

4:25

Additionally, consider whether any ads present detract from the content.

4:32

Is this site's purpose merely to inform or to sell a specific diet?

## Library Contact Information

4:39

For additional help on the CRAP test and evaluating sources, ask a librarian.

# Evaluating Secondary Sources

So you’ve done your research and have gathered a wealth of information – how do you go about trimming this information and deciding what is valid and what is not? Well, have you ever heard about the criteria called **CRAP**? (Don’t worry, we’re not violating the Code of Conduct!)

CRAP is a powerful mnemonic / easy-to-remember tool to help you evaluate your sources. Watch the video below to learn more about CRAP. After you watch ask yourself:

1. Have I understood what **each letter of the acronym CRAP means?**
2. Have I understood the **recommended steps** to follow and **questions to ask** when evaluating sources?

In addition to the CRAP considerations, you can also ask yourself the following additional questions to help you determine if a source is reliable:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/eedec3a2a296602411b8abd68983b3a78a38190e.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T104541Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=24620bfb19905d09b1868897c92d9569ef5b26d751a5b33f81e4e9ef2fe23d0d)

Keep in mind that everything is written from a particular social, cultural, and political perspective. Realize that some publications tend to be ‘slanted’ towards a certain viewpoint.

---

Identify a piece of writing or news that you just read. It can be anything; a newspaper article, an editorial piece or something your uncle forwarded to you on WhatsApp. Use the ==CRAP or SIFT== methods to evaluate the sources used in that piece of writing to determine whether they are legitimate or not. Share what you found, along with the context of the article, with your peers on eHub. Also, read through your peers’ responses to get a better understanding of the different forms of sources and their evaluation.



# Ethical Use of AI Tools for Web Research

  
**Let’s now dive into a fascinating and ever-evolving topic on ethics in the use of AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini for conducting web research.**

We now live in the AI age and as powerful as such tools are and are going to get, it’s important to understand the ethical considerations surrounding their use, especially in learning institutions.

Quick question for you:  

Why do you think the Ethical use of AI tools in web research is a thorny topic?

There are definitely a lot of answers to this question, but the main reasons for the complexities around the ethical use of AI tools in web research are due to concerns related to privacy, data bias, transparency, accountability, misinformation, and regulatory challenges. This necessitates a collaborative effort to establish ethical standards, ensure transparency, and prioritize data protection and user rights.

**Some standards and considerations you can take when using AI tools in your work include:**

- ==Full disclosure:== Always disclose when your work is AI-assisted by properly citing your sources. Passing off AI-generated work purely as your own is something we advise against.
- ==Transparency:== Your users will want to know that the data you are collecting from them will at some point pass through AI tools, which is something not every user is comfortable with!
- ==Responsibility:== Always use AI tools in a moral, ethical, and responsible manner.

**There are also some guiding principles to take into account when using AI tools for web research:**

- Use AI tools to supplement, not replace, human judgment. AI tools can be valuable for research, but they should not be used as a substitute for human judgment. It is important to carefully evaluate the results of AI tools and to use your critical thinking skills to make decisions.
- Be aware of the potential biases of AI tools. AI tools are trained on data that is collected from the real world, and this data can be biased. It is important to be aware of the potential biases of AI tools and to take steps to mitigate them.
- Use AI tools in a way that respects the privacy of others. AI tools can collect a large amount of data about users, and it is important to use this data in a way that respects the privacy of others. This means obtaining informed consent from users before collecting their data and using it only for the purposes that were disclosed to them.

**So now that you understand the ethics of AI-based research, and know what to look out for, let’s see how best to leverage these technologies to your advantage.**

As a principle, you should know that AI assistants like **[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/gpt-4)**, **[Gemini](https://bard.google.com/chat)**, and **[BingAI](https://www.bing.com/search?form=MY0291&OCID=MY0291&q=Bing+AI&showconv=1)** are very powerful, but they cannot do the research for you. They are “assistants” that can help you through the process, but you have to take the lead and make the decisions regarding what is and what is not important.

==Looking for the right information==

Let’s say you’re starting your research and want to know which articles and research papers to read. BingAI has you covered! You can use other assistants like Google’s Gemini to do the same. Just know that some of these language models aren’t connected to the internet and might not be able to provide up-to-date information.

When you’ve found the perfect article or paper that you want to read and analyze as part of your research, you can use AI tools to scan through articles and papers, and provide summaries or pull specific information that you need.

We encourage you to explore. Remember, to use AI ethically and responsibly. There are no shortcuts to life, and AI isn’t here to do your work for you. It’s just here to assist.

Storytelling is a powerful tool that plays an essential role in the workplace. Stories can help to convey complex information in a simple and relatable way, allowing stakeholders to ==better understand and connect== with new ideas and concepts. Sharing progress updates, success stories, and demonstrating growth potential can inspire and motivate.

Additionally, storytelling can help to create a sense of community and foster relationships among colleagues, helping to build a ==positive and productive work environment==. By incorporating storytelling into their communication strategies, organizations can better engage employees and clients, promote collaboration and creativity, and ultimately achieve greater success.

In this module, we will explore writing as a form of storytelling. In subsequent modules, we will explore other forms of telling compelling stories.

When we listen to stories as audience members, we unknowingly respond and make judgments in our head about whether the story resonates or “clicks” with us and how the speaker does this. Below are a few of the characteristics we typically watch out for in the stories we hear and what effective storytellers can do.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/40fa8b3bc7017e2d4417ef8d8d41e3e58458d2aa.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T111506Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=a7cfc208cd6c3a42381db931367a622ab61af8284771d2a6d2043e31946b8eb9)

Finding the right combination of the elements above in your storytelling can convert you into a powerful speaker!

**Now, it’s time for us to see storytelling in action. Listen to the presentations below and remember to watch out for how each speaker uses the different elements of our storytelling rubric:**

- Audience Relevance
- Language
- Voice
- Narratives
- Structuring

#### Video #1: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

**The danger of a single story:** What is the power of a story, especially when only one side gets to tell it? That is what Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a Nigerian novelist, argues in her TED Talk. She shares that a single story about a person or place can be dangerous. She gives an example of her experience of reading books with characters that didn’t look like her and her discovery of African literature that showed her different stories. Let’s watch the video to see how she uses an amazing narrative to explain the power of storytelling.

Storytelling takes place in various forms. Writing is one of the most commonly used forms of communication in the workplace, and it is extremely beneficial to understand the simple steps you can take to create relevant and compelling stories.

### **Steps to Professional Writing**

![Understanding Audience](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1E9ug8KLc73Ez0xmCOiboib8GaARNblxV)**

#### Step 1: Understanding the Audience

**

Who will be reading your writing? What do they already know about the topic? What are their needs and expectations? What kind of language and tone do they respond to most? By understanding your audience, you can tailor your writing to their specific interests and needs.

![Defining Purpose](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UPXCcrNyHGQ--5poHjQEaa0PZVp_yPcu)**

#### Step 2: Defining the Purpose

**

Once you know your audience, the next step is defining the purpose of your writing. What do you want to achieve with your writing? Are you trying to inform, persuade, or entertain? Knowing your purpose will help you stay focused and on track while you’re writing.

![Research Background](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/169YvyVC-AZ7fWBfAUnwrzqM8IV9c75vn)**

#### Step 3: Research Background Information

**

To ensure that your writing includes all essential information, facts, and figures, it is crucial to conduct thorough research on the topic. Including graphs, charts, and images can help illustrate key facts and information.

![Planning and Organizing](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TJtbHuPT8V2eDwEQ3IBoyMistg1yoGhJ)**

#### Step 4: Planning and Organizing

**

Before you start writing, plan and organize your ideas. Create an outline or a mind map to structure your writing. This helps in making your writing more coherent and easy to follow.

![Sticking to One Topic](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dw72CsUSM9Z_2mQGlsszxvMi8IU8W14M)**

#### Step 5: Stick to One Topic

**

Mixing an array of ideas in business writing reduces the effectiveness of the main message. Stay focused on one topic to avoid confusing the reader.

![Writing Clearly and Concisely](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1x29xlyDQnMlHDwrik8C59W81Rpw8gNsM)**

#### Step 6: Writing Clearly and Concisely

**

When it comes to professional writing, clarity and concision are key. Use simple, straightforward language, and avoid jargon or overly technical terms that your audience might not understand. Be concise and to the point, and avoid using unnecessary words or phrases.

![Proofreading and Editing](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VC_imw91f_wNpmV2VlbH-iR3mZp9sIEs)**

#### Step 7: Proofreading and Editing

**

After you’ve finished writing, it’s important to proofread and edit your work. Check for grammar and spelling mistakes, and make sure your writing is clear and easy to understand. Consider asking a colleague, friend, or Chat GPT to review your writing. Having a fresh set of eyes to look at your work can often catch mistakes or areas for improvement that you might have missed.

![Following Writing Etiquette](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1g0c6BLNcqEc8HiZpC9uSf_oLyPC1Tt3L)**

#### Step 8: Following Professional Writing Etiquette

**

In addition to the above principles, there are certain etiquette and formatting rules to follow in professional writing. This might include using proper salutations and closings in emails, using a professional tone and style, and adhering to formatting guidelines such as margins, font size, and spacing.

To write a good story, you need to follow a structured writing process, and most stories follow a particular structure called the **Story Arc**. The Story Arc has several parts, and each of them is essential to create a well-structured story. The following article explains the structure of the Story Arc and provides some amusing examples.

# Creating a Storytelling Outline

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T111941Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=087bc91fa23f51bd422a5750ac36e19b9e8959b0ff7a5932bec2476ec15eae5e)

To create a powerful story arc, it is essential to emphasize Step 3 of the writing process: organizing and planning. An effective tool that we can utilize for this purpose is called an outline.

You may already be familiar with outlines from your previous English classes back in high school. Outlines serve as excellent aids for listing the main parts of your story, ensuring a key message in each section, and connecting all the elements together in a compelling narrative or structure.

We are providing two videos on this page and the next page to give you a sense of two different approaches to outlining your story.

The first video focuses on writing an outline for a speech. Remember, as a tech professional, you won’t always have your computer to hide behind. At times, you will need to address an audience or make a presentation. Having a clearly outlined and engaging speech will be advantageous. Let’s take a look at the video below to understand all the key considerations of a speech outline.

Ask yourself as you watch:

1. Have I understood the flow and order of a speech outline?
2. Have I captured all the various components of a speech outline?
3. Have I understood the importance of the “Opening” and what it ties into?
4. What the “Close” needs to tie back to?

## Opening

0:20

opening how are you going to get your attention  and a lot of people talk about all you have to  

0:23

have a attention-getting opening but truly to  have a powerful opening it has to tie in to  

## Premise

0:30

the premise which is number two the premise the  premise is the idea that you're selling whether  

0:38

your corporate presenter trying to get across  a point about the new 401k plan an entrepreneur  

0:43

promoting your business or a professional  keynote speaker the premise is the core and

outline of a speech if there's any way possible  we want the clothes to tie back to the opening  

1:34

this really gives you that circular effect and  gives a the audience the idea that you're fully  

1:41

prepared that you know what you're doing and  it really makes you look like a pro so you're  

1:45

opening your premise state that the body maybe  have one to three points a call for action and  

1:52

then a strong close and whenever we can tie it  back to the opening I was at a convention this  

1:57

weekend and I was coaching someone and he had  a great opening and a great close but both of  

2:02

them had nothing to do with his premise but  he wasn't aware of that so for you make sure

0:04

Have you ever wondered how much ice cream you can get for a dollar?

0:07

Or what's the cheapest thing in an airport?

0:09

Or if it's faster to go inside or a drive-through?

0:12

Probably not.

0:14

But somehow, answering these weird questions

0:16

and sharing those experiences

0:18

have become my life's work.

0:20

Now even though I only have five minutes to share my viral storytelling framework,

0:24

great stories should be told in less than 60 seconds.

0:28

And it's not just about becoming a viral social media star.

0:31

It's about making your conversations better,

0:33

whether you’re with friends, family

0:35

or trying to convince your boss for a raise.

0:38

So here's how to make every second count.

0:41

Many great stories start with a question,

0:43

because it will make people stick until the end to find out the answer.

0:48

And remember, you want to get your audience's attention immediately,

0:51

so you want to start by asking something shocking.

0:53

And one of the things I've always wondered

0:56

was if fast food was really as fast as they say.

0:58

So I answered just this in a video

1:00

and got over 45 million views.

1:01

Let's check out how I hooked my viewers.

1:04

(Video) Can I have a burger?

1:05

Can you put cheese, lettuce and tomatoes? This thing's not hot enough.

1:08

(Laughter)

1:09

(Stage) That thing really wasn't hot enough.

1:13

But as you can see, I took this question very seriously.

1:17

And after you've hooked your audience, you want to take them on a journey,

1:20

building up to your answer,

1:21

where you want them to feel constant progression,

1:24

so we're moving closer and closer to our answer

1:27

so we feel like we can't stop listening.

1:30

And in my case, I did just this by saying

1:33

that I’ll be adding tomatoes, lettuce and cheese to the burger,

1:36

so now we know how close I am to finishing the competition, thus the video.

1:42

But if everything is smooth sailing, then nobody cares,

1:46

which is why we need to add conflict before getting to our answer.

1:50

So here's how I did that.

1:51

(Video) Yes, please. And cheese.

1:53

Mother: There's smoke in here.

1:54

Jenny Hoyos: This thing is still raw. Good thing there's a line.

1:57

Oh my goodness.

1:59

Mother: What are you doing? You're going to burn that car.

2:01

JH: I'll cut the tomatoes while this cooks.

2:03

Mother: I hope I don't have to eat that.

2:05

JH: Tell them to slow down.

2:07

Mother: You're doing all this for one subscriber?

2:09

You're going to make a mess.

2:11

JH: Put the ketchup on the buns.

2:14

(Stage) As you saw, without conflict, the audience just isn’t as invested,

2:20

which is why I used my mom as the B plot.

2:22

So you’re now not only invested in the competition

2:25

but also curious to see what's going to happen between my mom and I.

2:30

And after enough buildup, we finally need our answers.

2:36

Will I cook the burger faster?

2:38

Will I accidentally set my mom’s car on fire?

2:41

The key here is to build tension by making the answer feel uncertain

2:45

to make a satisfying ending.

2:47

Here's how I did just that.

2:49

(Video) We’re one person away.

2:50

We just need the burger to cook faster.

2:52

Mother: We're moving, we're moving.

2:54

JH: No, my burger is not done yet. You're driving too crazy.

2:58

It needs to cook faster.

3:00

Mother: We're next.

3:02

(Music)

3:04

JH: We're pulling up to the window.

3:06

(Music)

3:07

And, oh my goodness!

3:08

(Music)

3:13

We cooked faster and better.

3:16

(Laughter)

3:18

(Applause)

3:20

And that's it. We cooked faster than the drive-through.

3:22

Does it matter that my burger was basically raw?

3:25

Absolutely not.

3:27

Because the viewers wanted an answer,

3:28

so I gave it to them quickly and concisely, in an engaging way,

3:32

which led our video to getting over 45 million views.

3:36

And you might be impressed to know

3:38

that instead of telling this talk in five minutes, I actually did it in four,

3:42

so you now have an extra minute to practice your 60-second story.

3:46

(Laughter)

3:47

Because if it takes longer to tell your story than it does to make a burger,

3:51

then you're probably overcooking both.

3:53

(Laughter)

3:54

Thank you.

3:55

Now that you have learned about story arcs and outlines, it’s time to start writing!

In addition to the writing process we discussed earlier, writing has best practices that one should follow to tell compelling stories. Let’s look at these best practices from a broader communication standpoint, and then from a writing perspective.

#### **Communication Best Practices**

When you are writing to communicate information, your writing must meet these 7 key elements. They’re also called the “7 C’s of Communication”.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/ba9301ff8d5eed776149db7046daefb1e5cb4bf2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T142032Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=f9d96f4615df1d5a1079420f068a9dba137343cc409f0daf615e18141dfc07c2)

#### **Writing Best Practices**

With the 7C’s of communication in mind, let’s focus a little more on writing to tell a story or communicate.

Now take time to read this **[business article](https://www.grammarly.com/business/learn/top-principles-effective-business-writing/)** that gives specific writing best practices. As you read, take note of the 8 elements of good writing.

# Technical Writing

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/be5ab1ec6020dd2bfadc24559e2e59df5c0734b2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251020%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251020T142140Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=90cb9e05817f519cf7955782e2539ad22127eb4a544c95c5ceb1311c98227c41)

  

Generally, the tips that you have already learned apply to any kind of writing. As a young tech professional, you will likely be asked at some point to read and/or produce _technical writing._

Technical writing is a form of communication that conveys complex technical or specialized information in a clear and concise manner to a specific audience. It is usually used for the purpose of informing, instructing, or facilitating decision-making.

Technical writing requires both creativity and logic so that technical information can be clearly explained to a specified audience. In good technical writing, complex concepts and processes are broken down into easy-to-understand language. It is common that diagrams, charts, and other visual storytelling aids are used. Technical writers may create a variety of documents, such as user manuals, technical specifications, training materials, and research reports.

Examples of Technical Writing

- User manuals for software or hardware products, which provide step-by-step instructions on how to use them.
- Technical specifications for products or systems, which detail the technical requirements and capabilities of a product.
- Training materials for employees or customers, which teach them how to perform specific tasks or use specific tools.
- White papers or research reports, which communicate the results of technical research or analysis to a wider audience.
- Safety manuals or procedures, which provide guidelines and instructions on how to safely use equipment or handle hazardous materials.

Technical writing plays a critical role in bridging the gap between technical experts and their intended audiences, making complex information accessible and usable for a wide range of readers.

Let’s meet and watch technical writers from Google as they share insights on the importance of technical writing and the paramount role played by technical writers in the world of tech.

As you watch this 2-minute video, ask yourself:

- Have I understood the role that technical writing plays in the tech world?
- What considerations do technical writers make to call their work a success?

#### This is insanely cool!

And did you notice how the user is at the core of the technical writing process?
