Daily 3: Morning Pages

Don’t Stop | Don’t Think | Just Write!

This week, you should continue practicing your daily habit of Movement (and logging it). You will now also start incorporating Morning Pages into your daily routine. We shared some of the immense benefits of writing Morning Pages in Week 1 and we want you to feel equipped to make them a part of your day-to-day.

Intro

0:00

Sometimes this is how my brain feels

0:02

and sometimes it feels like this.

0:05

There's just a lot of things to think about and sometimes they

0:07

get in the way of doing other things, like being creative and making art.

0:11

So I decided to try something that might help with that.

0:16

This is the book The Artist's Way.

0:18

And in it, Julia Cameron talks about the daily practice of morning pages,

0:23

three pages of daily longhand, stream of consciousness written

0:26

first thing upon arising.

0:27

There are a lot of people who have claimed that morning pages changed their life,

0:31

so I thought I would commit to 30 days of writing morning pages

0:34

to see if they might change my life too

0:41

the first week went by pretty easily.

0:44

All right. Week one, check in.

0:45

I'm feeling very optimistic about writing morning pages, and I definitely see how

0:49

they can be really helpful.

0:50

I've always enjoyed writing out my thoughts

0:52

and it helps me sort through whatever's been going through my mind lately

0:55

and doing it in this way

0:56

feels a little more productive than writing in a typical journal.

How to write morning pages

1:00

Morning pages are meant to be a simple practice with big results.

1:04

The pages are simple yet profound.

1:06

We discover an inner voice that speaks to us with greater and greater clarity.

1:10

Now, while there's no wrong way to do them, you can do whatever is best for you.

1:14

There are some aspects to consider so that you get the most out of them.

1:18

As I mentioned, morning pages should be done daily and first thing in the morning.

1:22

This is because the pages

1:24

are not meant to be a recounting of what happened in the day you just had.

1:27

It's not like a journal or a diary where you document the events of each day.

1:31

It's a way to clear our minds and prepare us for the day ahead.

1:34

They give us space in our brain

1:36

so that we can approach the rest of the day with more clarity.

1:43

Check in number two.

1:45

So I've been doing morning pages for two weeks now and I have managed

1:48

to keep up with it every day, making sure to write at least something.

1:51

It has been really helpful

1:52

when there is something immediately that I've been thinking about a lot

1:55

that I need to work through and it helps a lot to write it down.

1:59

But when there's not something

2:01

that's immediately on my mind, I feel like it's a chore.

2:04

But with that being said, I still feel like it's important to do it

2:07

every day as a daily habit rather than just the days that you feel like doing it.

2:11

Even when it feels like pushing a boulder up a hill.

2:13

Having the daily practice will prepare you for being creative.

2:17

This is because

2:17

discipline is an often overlooked but key aspect of living a creative life.

2:22

And no matter what it is, you write.

2:23

Keeping up with the daily habit will produce benefits as well.

2:29

Which brings me to my next point.

2:30

What does it mean to write stream of consciousness and why is it important?

2:35

As I mentioned, this is not a journal.

2:37

Think of it more like a brain dump.

2:39

A way to rid yourself of those unwanted thoughts.

2:41

Living rent free in your brain.

2:43

Thoughts like what Julia Cameron calls mental static

2:46

that pesky voice that follows you around saying things like

2:49

you need to sort the laundry or don't forget to buy some pasta.

2:53

These are just noise that cloud

2:55

your thoughts and keep you from focusing on your priorities.

2:58

You may also find yourself using morning pages for venting and ranting and whining.

3:03

That's normal.

3:04

They can be used to take

3:05

those negative thoughts out of your brain so that you left with the optimistic

3:08

and hopeful thoughts for the rest of the day.

3:12

That's why morning pages are unique.

3:13

They're not meant to be high art.

3:15

You're not trying to write something profound.

3:17

In fact, it's best to avoid any kind of perfectionism with these.

3:21

They're meant to be messy, so you may end up writing sentences

3:24

that are only half finished or that don't make any sense.

3:27

Or you may write pointless things like I don't know what to write.

3:32

You also shouldn't let anyone else read these,

3:34

and you probably shouldn't go back and read them yourself.

3:37

You write them and then you're done with them.

3:40

The third recommendation is that

3:42

you write three full pages in longhand.

3:45

Now, if the idea of writing that much seems daunting, use a smaller book.

3:49

The goal is to commit to finishing three full pages,

3:51

no matter how much writing that actually is.

3:54

However, Julia Cameron does believe that three pages of eight and a half by 11

3:58

paper is the most ideal.

4:00

Also, the

4:01

book itself isn't that important, just as long as it's

4:04

one dedicated to your morning pages and nothing else.

4:08

So you might be wondering why you have to use a pen when it's

4:11

the 21st century and we have computers and even phones we could use

4:15

if that's what's best for you, write your morning pages digitally.

4:18

However, you will see more results if you write them in longhand.

4:22

This is because longhand requires us to slow down.

4:26

And by slowing down, we connect to our emotions and our intuitions.

4:30

Writing things down instead of typing them makes our words carry more importance.

4:33

It's not easy to delete or backtrack on what we are saying.

4:37

It takes more time and it doesn't allow for editing.

4:40

Typing may be less time consuming and more efficient,

4:43

but efficient doesn't include better in this case.

4:46

Writing by hand allows for more reflection and self-awareness,

4:49

and you're less likely to be emotionally detached from the practice.

4:59

There are

5:00

definitely days where it feels very helpful

5:03

to just get whatever is on my mind onto the page.

5:07

And then there's days where it's like just pushing through.

5:11

It's like walking through mud.

5:12

It's not fun.

5:14

Page two almost always feels like a chore.

5:17

On page one, I can write whatever is immediately on my mind.

5:21

And then page two is like, What do I write next?

5:24

What do I write next?

5:25

And then I'll usually come up with something and fill up page three.

5:28

But page two is hard.

5:31

It's important to know that you're not always going to be in

5:33

the mood to do your morning pages, so it's best

5:35

to set everything up beforehand so there's less resistance.

5:39

You may find that having a specific spot helps

5:42

somewhere that's comfortable and free from distractions.

5:45

Or you may want to silence your phone, grab a drink, or even feed

5:48

the cat ahead of time.

5:52

You may prefer to have some music playing in the background,

5:54

something free from lyrics so it doesn't call your attention away.

5:58

I find that headphones are the best option to keep

6:00

me from getting distracted.

6:06

Okay, check in number three.

6:07

I think that I'm at a point now where I'm really starting

6:11

to see the value in this in almost any way.

6:15

Even when I don't have as much to say, I think it's becoming a little easier

6:19

for me to find something to say.

6:21

I felt a lot better about doing morning pages this week than I did last week.

6:25

I was feeling really frustrated last week, and I think it's because

6:28

I wasn't in the right mindset whenever I was sitting down.

6:31

I was in this kind of impatient, I just want to get this over

6:35

with type mindset.

6:36

And this week I really tried to make sure that I was setting aside this time

6:40

and being very intentional with This is what I'm doing right now.

6:44

And so it's a lot easier for me to sit down and relax and not feel frustrated

6:47

and not feel like this was a chore or something that I had to do.

6:50

I just enjoyed my time as I was doing it.

Benefits

6:57

All of this may sound like

6:58

a lot of work and you may be thinking, I don't have time for that.

7:01

But the benefits far outweigh the time used by getting up

7:04

30 minutes earlier, or by putting away social media for an extra 30 minutes.

7:08

You could be freeing up time for something that will improve your whole day

7:12

or in life. As many people claim.

7:14

When Julia Cameron is asked

7:16

why she writes morning pages, she says to get to the other side,

7:20

the other side of our fear, our negativity, of our moods.

7:24

There really are so many benefits that come with writing morning

7:26

pages, though, and I don't think I could even list half of them.

7:29

But I will tell you about some of the ones that I experience the most.

7:34

The first and main benefit I had from morning pages

7:37

is the clarity being able to dump all of my noisy

7:40

thoughts onto the page made room for more important thoughts.

7:43

This made my day feel way less overwhelming,

7:46

kind of like having a clean desk to work at.

7:50

The second benefit was problem identification and solving.

7:54

A lot of times I have a problem lurking in the back of my head

7:56

that is affecting my day, but I either don't have a way to solve it

8:00

or I don't even know what it is so that I can solve it when I sit down

8:03

and write stream of consciousness.

8:05

The problem tends to reveal itself.

8:09

The third benefit was the improvement of my stress and anxiety.

8:13

A lot of my worries come from things that I can't change,

8:15

but they still roll around in my brain when I put them down on paper.

8:18

It takes their power away sometimes.

8:21

Once those anxieties are on the page, I realize there's something

8:24

that I won't even be thinking about ten days from now.

8:26

The anxiety shrink.

8:28

They're way less consequential.

8:33

The fourth benefit is having a place to rant.

8:35

I can be negative and complain if I need to without affecting anyone else.

8:40

And a lot of times, once I do that, the pages hold up a mirror back at me.

8:43

This provokes me to have grace

8:45

when I need to or to examine why those things are bothering me.

8:49

With understanding comes the ability to manage my emotions.

8:52

I do think it's important to note, however, that you don't want to develop

8:55

a habit of complaining.

8:57

So be careful about making negative statements.

9:00

My fifth benefit is productivity, decision making and goal setting.

9:04

One of my biggest problems is being able to prioritize tasks.

9:08

When your to do list is long and just glaring at you, it's overwhelming

9:11

to try and pick what you should do next.

9:13

What I noticed with Morning Pages

9:15

is that the most important things were to repeat themselves in my writing.

9:19

If there was something I was putting off, I would be able to see that

9:22

and start examining why.

9:24

If I felt stuck, I could debate my next step.

9:27

I could debate the pros and cons of something I was considering doing.

9:30

Sometimes I would learn that there is something

9:32

that I've been wanting to try that I've never considered before.

9:35

Things tend to pop up in the pages and urge you to give them a chance.

9:40

Morning pages

9:41

may hold insights and intuitions that startle you.

9:44

Typically, they puncture denial.

9:47

That brings me to my next benefit, which is discovering

9:50

what I like and what I don't like, crazy as it seems.

9:53

Sometimes we don't know what we like.

9:55

Sometimes we don't have an answer to how we want to be spending our time.

9:59

This can be in the broad sense, as in feeling lost

10:02

or looking for meaning and purpose.

10:03

Or it could be smaller,

10:05

like discovering you enjoy baking cookies in the shape of cartoon characters.

10:09

It's easy to be so wrapped up in our day to day lives, our routines

10:13

and our work to the point that we don't even know

10:15

what things bring us joy and what things drain us.

10:18

Once you realize that you keep talking about cookies in your morning

10:21

pages, you realize that you might want to start making time to bake.

10:25

Finally, the seventh

10:26

benefit I got from morning pages is creativity.

10:29

Morning pages themselves are not art,

10:32

but they do help us with art and creativity indirectly.

10:35

Although the content of morning pages seems to have nothing to do with art,

10:39

they often move us first to more artful lives and then to art itself.

10:44

This could be by quieting the inner critic that keeps telling me

10:46

I can't do something.

10:47

Or because I'm being less analytic with these pages,

10:50

I'm able to be more imaginative, almost like being a kid again.

10:54

Also, as I mentioned earlier, they help with discipline.

10:57

In your creative practice.

10:59

They help with creative blocks.

11:01

They give you a chance to find new ideas.

11:03

And since people are more creative in the morning, getting up first thing

11:07

in writing allows for more opportunities to catch these new ideas.

11:10

And that's how it feels while you're writing morning pages.

11:13

New ideas seemingly pop up on their own, and you get to pluck them from the pages.

11:18

The morning pages teach logic brain to stand aside and

11:21

let artists brain play.

Final thoughts

11:25

I could definitely go on longer talking about the benefits

11:28

of this simple exercise on your life, but I will leave you with those seven.

11:32

Definitely.

11:33

Check out the first few chapters of The Artist's Way book by Julia

11:36

Cameron if you want to learn more.

11:39

All right.

11:40

It's been 30 days, so this is my final check in.

11:42

I can't say that these have been life changing for me specifically.

11:45

I know a lot of people call them that,

11:47

but I will say that I plan to continue to do these indefinitely.

11:51

I think that they are very helpful to my life.

11:53

It has been great for removing all that static in my brain,

11:55

all those other thoughts that I don't want to deal with all day

11:58

so that I can just start focusing on the things that I want to be creative with.

12:02

It really is just so helpful to get all of the noise out of your brain

12:06

and get it down onto the paper

12:07

so that you don't have to think about it to open your brain

12:09

up to all the creativity that you can be doing.

12:12

The prompts have been helpful.

12:13

I have checked a few online and used those and then I made my own list

12:17

and those are things that I gravitate towards

12:19

writing about anyways in my morning pages.

12:21

So it has been helpful to just have that kind of specific focus

12:25

for the day of what I'm going to write about.

12:27

What I have discovered over the past

12:29

30 days is that morning pages clean out all the clutter in my brain.

12:33

It's a personal and private way for me to express myself without censorship.

12:37

And because of that, I am able to understand myself better

12:40

what I like, what I don't like, what I want, what I don't want.

12:44

Morning pages uncover interests and opinions

12:47

and enthusiasms that I didn't even know existed.

12:50

It also helps reveal problems and then sometimes answers to those problems.

12:55

Morning pages are a tool for discovering

12:57

where you are, where you want to go, and how you want to get there.

13:02

I highly recommend morning pages for anyone, whether you're an artist

13:05

or not, and I hope you give them at least a 30 day chance

13:11

if you are considering trying out morning pages.

13:13

I created a free prompt list that I will link in the description.

13:17

Thank you so much for watching this video to the end.

13:19

If you found it valuable

13:20

and you'd like to support me, don't forget to give it a like.

13:23

And I hope you have a great rest of your day.

Article: Everything I Learned From Doing Morning Pages

As we already mentioned, Morning Pages are a concept from the classic bestselling book on creativity The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron, first published in 1992. Here are some quotes from Cameron that sum up why she believes so strongly in doing morning pages:

“When people ask, ‘Why do we write morning pages?’ I joke, ‘To get to the other side.’ They think I am kidding, but I’m not. Morning pages do get us to the other side: the other side of our fear, our negativity, of our moods.”

“It is impossible to write morning pages for any extended period without coming into contact with an unexpected inner power. Although I used them for many years before I realized this, the pages are a pathway to a strong and clear sense of self.”

“Pages clarify our yearnings. They keep an eye on our goals. … If we are drifting, the pages will point that out. They will point the way True North. Each morning, as we face the page, we meet ourselves.”

Morning pages are about tuning out our inner critic. “We learn to hear our censor’s comments and say, simply, ‘Thank you for sharing,’ while we go right on writing. We are training our censor to stand aside and let us create.”

“The pages may seem dull to you, even pointless, but they are not. Remember that they are not intended to be ‘art.’ They pave the way for art. Each page you write is a small manifesto. You are declaring your freedom — freedom from your Censor, freedom from negativity in any quarter.”

“The morning pages teach logic brain to stand aside and let artist brain play.”

“Morning pages may hold insights and intuitions that startle you. Typically, they puncture denial.”

“Write your pages daily and be open to their suggestions.”

Morning Pages: Challenge

Let’s do some writing!

So now that you are all clued up on how to do Morning Pages and the benefits they bring, we have a mini challenge for you.

The Challenge

For the next 7 days (1 week straight) we challenge you to:

Write every single day (even when you don’t feel like it or the odds are tight)

Write at a set time each day (we highly recommend mornings, as soon as you wake up)

Write 3 regular-sized notebook pages by hand each day

Put perfectionism aside, just for this activity. Just write anything you want, without overthinking it.

Don’t stop writing until you have your 3 pages.

Don’t re-read it or edit it.

Complete each of these steps for 7 days straight so you too can have your mic-drop moment.

When you do succeed in writing you first morning page, you have our permission to flex a little in your squads. So get those brags ready! Share you experience with others to encourage them to follow suit as well. Good things must be celebrated. Happy Writing!Here is a quick recap of how Morning Pages work:

Doing them first thing when you wake up is the best. But any time of day is ok.

Get a pen and paper (or a journal) and write! The benefits come from doing this by hand - no typing!

Write whatever pops into your head! (Really, whatever’s there. Anything! Just write it!)

Don’t stop writing. Don’t re-read what you’ve written. Don’t go back and edit.

If you don’t know what to write, then write, “I don’t know what to write. Maybe it’s because…” and you’re off again. Just keep the pen moving!

Write 3 full pages.

When you’re done, put them in an envelope (or burn them)! Don’t re-read them. Don’t share them with anyone.

Remember, the point of Morning Pages is the process and not the product.

The most important thing is that you write something by hand and that you do it every day.

One thing that is important to remember with morning pages is that what you write matters a lot less than the fact that you write something. So make sure you give yourself permission to write absolutely anything. Don’t overthink it. Just write. Think of it as “clearing out the pipes” so that you have more space to do focused and creative work.

You may not be convinced that this practice is right for you. That’s okay. But we ask that you try it for 1 week. Treat it as an experiment. We challenge you to do it every day for 7 days straight and notice what impact it has on your mood, focus, and overall productivity. What have you got to lose? Many very successful people vouch for this process, so give it a shot and see for yourself what happens! Morning Pages: 30 Day Challenge Report

0:44

Recognising emotion in other people, then communicating that.

0:48

Empathy is feeling WITH people.

0:51

I always think of empathy as this kind of sacred space.

0:56

When someone's in a deep hole and they shout from the bottom...

1:04

..And we look and we say, "Hey!" And climb down...

1:12

Sympathy is, "Ooh!" (LAUGHTER)

1:15

"It's bad, uh-huh?" (LAUGHTER)

1:18

"Uh... No. You want a sandwich?"

1:24

Empathy is a choice and it's a vulnerable choice.

1:27

In order to connect with you,

1:29

I have to connect with something in myself that knows that feeling.

1:34

Rarely, if ever, does an empathic response begin with, "At least..."

1:39

(LAUGHTER)

1:41

Yeah. And we do it all the time because, you know what?

1:45

Someone shared something with us that's incredibly painful

1:48

and we're trying to "silver lining" it.

1:51

I don't think that's a verb, but I'm using it as one.

1:54

We're trying to put a silver lining around it.

1:56

So, "I had a miscarriage."

1:58

"At least you know you can get pregnant."

2:01

"I think my marriage is falling apart."

2:03

"At least you have a marriage."

2:05

(LAUGHTER)

2:08

"John's getting kicked out of school."

2:11

"At least Sarah is an A-student."

2:13

One of the things we do sometimes

2:15

in the face of very difficult conversations

2:19

is we try to make things better.

2:22

If I share something with you that's very difficult, I'd rather you say,

2:26

"I don't even know what to say. I'm just so glad you told me."

2:31

Because the truth is, rarely can a response make something better.

2:36

What makes something better is connection. The Importance of Empathy (1)

Next up, watch this video by Daniel Goleman as he speaks on the three kinds of empathy.

Reflect:

As you complete the content from the previous and next couple of pages, think about the following questions:

How do the resources above define empathy?

Why is it important to be empathetic?

What are the different types of empathy Daniel Goleman shares?

What similarities and distinctions do you observe among Goleman’s various types of empathy?

How important is empathy in leadership

0:08

b.com Daniel you talk a lot about

0:11

empathy in leadership and how important

0:13

it is and you bring up different types

0:15

of empathy including cognitive empathy

0:17

and emotional empathy Etc so can you

0:19

just give us some insights as to how

0:21

empathy is so Central to leadership

0:24

success empathy is one of the critical

0:26

components of social intelligence and

0:28

Leadership abilities but in the

0:31

conversation I did with Paul Ekman who's

0:32

a world expert on empathy uh in the

0:35

wired to connect

0:36

series I realize that there are three

0:39

kinds of empathy and each one of them

0:42

has strengths that are critical for

0:45

effective leadership but in different

0:47

ways and some of them have liabilities

0:49

the first one is cognitive empathy that

0:52

means I see I understand how you think

0:56

about things I can see things from your

0:58

perspective

1:00

and that can be very effective for

1:01

example for giving performance feedback

1:03

or for uh communication because I know

1:06

how to put it to you in a way that

1:08

you'll really be able to hear that makes

1:09

sense for

1:11

you uh so that's the upside the downside

1:15

is that people who only have cognitive

1:17

empathy and who have Twisted motivation

1:20

if you will can uh use it to manipulate

1:24

people uh if if you only care about

1:26

yourself you don't care about the other

1:28

person you can use them that to your

1:30

advantage and you see that in in

1:32

narcissistic leaders you see it in

1:34

mellian types you see it in outright

1:38

sociopaths uh they use their

1:41

understanding of the other person to

1:43

manipulate them because they don't have

Emotional empathy

1:45

the second kind of empathy the second

1:47

kind of empathy is emotional empathy I

1:50

feel with you if I don't care about how

1:53

you feel then I don't mind making you

1:55

feel terribly or I don't mind taking

1:58

great advantage of you but if I feel

2:00

you're distress it's much harder for me

2:02

to do that emotional empathy is also

2:05

critical for leadership for any any job

2:09

where you relate to people client

2:12

management Sales Management Teamwork

2:14

because it's the emotional empathy that

2:17

creates chemistry that creates the sense

2:19

of being in rapport with other people

2:22

that creates uh sympatico and it's in

2:25

those moments where things go at their

2:27

best top performing teams have this

2:31

sense of Harmony and of emotional uh

2:34

connection with each other for example

2:36

so the emotional empathy is absolutely

2:38

critical however downside here is that

2:42

for example if you're you know you're

2:44

the person in HR who has to go around

2:45

and tell everybody that you're fired or

2:48

you're um a nurse working in pediatric

2:52

oncology and you're uh all day long

2:55

you're with children who are in great

2:57

pain are who are going to die

3:00

th this is these are very powerful

3:04

situations emotionally and you pick up

3:07

the distress that other people are

3:08

feeling if you can't metabolize that if

3:11

you can't manage it yourself it can lead

3:13

to a kind of emotional exhaustion which

3:15

is a Prelude to burnout so and you feel

3:18

I've got to get out of this feel I can't

3:20

do this anymore so the counter to

3:24

emotional empathy and what allows you to

3:27

use it effectively is emotional

3:30

self-management skills which is one of

3:32

the four parts of emotional intelligence

3:34

emotional intelligence is self-awareness

Empathic concern

3:38

self-management empathy and relationship

3:41

skills so the different components work

3:44

together the Third Kind of empathy is

3:46

empathic concern and this is the uh felt

3:52

sense that when I see that you're in

3:56

trouble I spontaneously want to help you

3:59

out this actually is what makes leaders

4:02

outstanding these are the leaders who

4:03

for example take the time to help people

4:06

develop further strengths take the time

4:09

to give feedback corrective feedback

4:12

they see that and are genuinely

4:15

concerned about helping people get

4:17

better learn to do better and that of

4:19

course strengthens the capacity of the

4:21

whole organization these are all it's

4:23

also what makes people outstanding

4:25

organizational citizens these are the

4:26

people who aren't just it's me first and

4:28

that's all I care about but are good

4:30

team players are willing to help out

4:32

other people and so on so in this kind

4:35

of in a dark time

4:37

economically the leaders who will be

4:39

most effective have all three capacities

4:42

going at full

4:49

strength b.com Average: 94.46%

Empathy for Problem Solving

That statement jumped out in this 2-minute read called The Art of Problem Solving by Chris Stathakis. Read and pay special attention to the differences between empathetic and Non-empathetic problem-solving. We will talk more about problem-solving in the coming weeks. For now, you need to grasp the value of empathy and its pivotal role in problem-solving.

Importance of Empathy (2)

Still curious and eager to learn more about empathy? Well, we love this TED talk by Daniel Goleman called Why Aren’t We More Compassionate? As you watch this 12-minute TED talk ask yourself:

Why are people less compassionate than they could be?

What circumstances make people more compassionate?

You know, I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED

0:17

is compassion, these very moving demonstrations we've just seen:

0:21

HIV in Africa, President Clinton last night.

0:25

And I'd like to do a little collateral thinking, if you will,

0:30

about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal.

0:35

I'm a psychologist, but rest assured,

0:37

I will not bring it to the scrotal.

0:39

(Laughter)

0:44

There was a very important study done a while ago

0:46

at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is

0:51

that when all of us have so many opportunities to help,

0:54

we do sometimes, and we don't other times.

0:58

A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary

1:02

were told that they were going to give a practice sermon

1:06

and they were each given a sermon topic.

1:09

Half of those students were given, as a topic,

1:12

the parable of the Good Samaritan:

1:14

the man who stopped the stranger in --

1:17

to help the stranger in need by the side of the road.

1:19

Half were given random Bible topics.

1:22

Then one by one, they were told they had to go to another building

1:26

and give their sermon.

1:27

As they went from the first building to the second,

1:30

each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning,

1:34

clearly in need. The question is: Did they stop to help?

1:38

The more interesting question is:

1:40

Did it matter they were contemplating the parable

1:43

of the Good Samaritan? Answer: No, not at all.

1:48

What turned out to determine whether someone would stop

1:51

and help a stranger in need

1:52

was how much of a hurry they thought they were in --

1:56

were they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed

2:00

in what they were going to talk about.

2:02

And this is, I think, the predicament of our lives:

2:05

that we don't take every opportunity to help

2:09

because our focus is in the wrong direction.

2:12

There's a new field in brain science, social neuroscience.

2:16

This studies the circuitry in two people's brains

2:20

that activates while they interact.

2:22

And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience

2:26

is that our default wiring is to help.

2:30

That is to say, if we attend to the other person,

2:35

we automatically empathize, we automatically feel with them.

2:39

There are these newly identified neurons, mirror neurons,

2:41

that act like a neuro Wi-Fi, activating in our brain

2:45

exactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel "with" automatically.

2:49

And if that person is in need, if that person is suffering,

2:54

we're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument.

2:58

But then the question is: Why don't we?

3:01

And I think this speaks to a spectrum

3:04

that goes from complete self-absorption,

3:07

to noticing, to empathy and to compassion.

3:09

And the simple fact is, if we are focused on ourselves,

3:14

if we're preoccupied, as we so often are throughout the day,

3:17

we don't really fully notice the other.

3:20

And this difference between the self and the other focus

3:22

can be very subtle.

3:23

I was doing my taxes the other day, and I got to the point

3:27

where I was listing all of the donations I gave,

3:30

and I had an epiphany, it was -- I came to my check

3:33

to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought,

3:36

boy, my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy

3:39

that I gave money to Seva.

3:40

Then I realized that what I was getting from giving

3:43

was a narcissistic hit -- that I felt good about myself.

3:47

Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas

3:52

whose cataracts would be helped, and I realized

3:55

that I went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus

3:59

to altruistic joy, to feeling good

4:02

for the people that were being helped. I think that's a motivator.

4:06

But this distinction between focusing on ourselves

4:09

and focusing on others

4:10

is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to.

4:13

You can see it at a gross level in the world of dating.

4:17

I was at a sushi restaurant a while back

4:20

and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman,

4:24

who was in the singles scene. And this woman says,

4:27

"My brother is having trouble getting dates,

4:29

so he's trying speed dating." I don't know if you know speed dating?

4:31

Women sit at tables and men go from table to table,

4:35

and there's a clock and a bell, and at five minutes, bingo,

4:39

the conversation ends and the woman can decide

4:41

whether to give her card or her email address to the man

4:45

for follow up. And this woman says,

4:47

"My brother's never gotten a card, and I know exactly why.

4:51

The moment he sits down, he starts talking non-stop about himself;

4:56

he never asks about the woman."

4:58

And I was doing some research in the Sunday Styles section

5:03

of The New York Times, looking at the back stories of marriages --

5:06

because they're very interesting -- and I came to the marriage

5:09

of Alice Charney Epstein. And she said

5:12

that when she was in the dating scene,

5:15

she had a simple test she put people to.

5:18

The test was: from the moment they got together,

5:20

how long it would take the guy to ask her a question

5:23

with the word "you" in it.

5:25

And apparently Epstein aced the test, therefore the article.

5:29

(Laughter)

5:30

Now this is a -- it's a little test

5:32

I encourage you to try out at a party.

5:34

Here at TED there are great opportunities.

5:38

The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called

5:41

"The Human Moment," about how to make real contact

5:44

with a person at work. And they said, well,

5:47

the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry,

5:51

close your laptop, end your daydream

5:55

and pay full attention to the person.

5:58

There is a newly coined word in the English language

6:03

for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry

6:06

or answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist.

6:10

The word is "pizzled": it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off.

6:14

(Laughter)

6:17

I think it's quite apt. It's our empathy, it's our tuning in

6:24

which separates us from Machiavellians or sociopaths.

6:27

I have a brother-in-law who's an expert on horror and terror --

6:32

he wrote the Annotated Dracula, the Essential Frankenstein --

6:35

he was trained as a Chaucer scholar,

6:36

but he was born in Transylvania

6:38

and I think it affected him a little bit.

6:40

At any rate, at one point my brother-in-law, Leonard,

6:44

decided to write a book about a serial killer.

6:46

This is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in

6:50

many years ago. He was known as the Santa Cruz strangler.

6:53

And before he was arrested, he had murdered his grandparents,

6:57

his mother and five co-eds at UC Santa Cruz.

7:01

So my brother-in-law goes to interview this killer

7:04

and he realizes when he meets him

7:06

that this guy is absolutely terrifying.

7:08

For one thing, he's almost seven feet tall.

7:10

But that's not the most terrifying thing about him.

7:13

The scariest thing is that his IQ is 160: a certified genius.

7:19

But there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy,

7:23

feeling with the other person.

7:25

They're controlled by different parts of the brain.

7:28

So at one point, my brother-in-law gets up the courage

7:31

to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to,

7:33

and that is: how could you have done it?

7:36

Didn't you feel any pity for your victims?

7:38

These were very intimate murders -- he strangled his victims.

7:42

And the strangler says very matter-of-factly,

7:44

"Oh no. If I'd felt the distress, I could not have done it.

7:49

I had to turn that part of me off. I had to turn that part of me off."

7:55

And I think that that is very troubling,

8:01

and in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off.

8:05

When we focus on ourselves in any activity,

8:08

we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person.

8:12

Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities

8:17

of a compassionate consumerism.

8:20

Right now, as Bill McDonough has pointed out,

8:24

the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences.

8:28

We're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot.

8:32

We don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice

8:35

the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats.

8:42

Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological

8:47

or manufacturing nutrient; it can be reused

8:51

or does it just end up at landfill? In other words,

8:53

we're oblivious to the ecological and public health

8:59

and social and economic justice consequences

9:02

of the things we buy and use.

9:06

In a sense, the room itself is the elephant in the room,

9:10

but we don't see it. And we've become victims

9:14

of a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this.

9:18

There's a wonderful book called

9:22

Stuff: The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects.

9:25

And it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt.

9:28

And it talks about where the cotton was grown

9:31

and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences

9:33

for soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions, for instance,

9:37

that cotton is very resistant to textile dye;

9:40

about 60 percent washes off into wastewater.

9:43

And it's well known by epidemiologists that kids

9:46

who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia.

9:52

There's a company, Bennett and Company, that supplies Polo.com,

9:57

Victoria's Secret -- they, because of their CEO, who's aware of this,

10:03

in China formed a joint venture with their dye works

10:07

to make sure that the wastewater

10:09

would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater.

10:13

Right now, we don't have the option to choose the virtuous t-shirt

10:18

over the non-virtuous one. So what would it take to do that?

10:25

Well, I've been thinking. For one thing,

10:28

there's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store

10:33

to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store.

10:38

You can track it back to the factory. Once you can track it

10:40

back to the factory, you can look at the manufacturing processes

10:44

that were used to make it, and if it's virtuous,

10:48

you can label it that way. Or if it's not so virtuous,

10:52

you can go into -- today, go into any store,

10:56

put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode,

10:59

which will take you to a website.

11:01

They have it for people with allergies to peanuts.

11:04

That website could tell you things about that object.

11:07

In other words, at point of purchase,

11:08

we might be able to make a compassionate choice.

11:12

There's a saying in the world of information science:

11:18

ultimately everybody will know everything.

11:21

And the question is: will it make a difference?

11:25

Some time ago when I was working for The New York Times,

11:29

it was in the '80s, I did an article

11:31

on what was then a new problem in New York --

11:33

it was homeless people on the streets.

11:35

And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency

11:39

that ministered to the homeless. And I realized seeing the homeless

11:42

through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients

11:47

that had nowhere to go. They had a diagnosis. It made me --

11:52

what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where,

11:56

when we see, when we're passing someone who's homeless

11:59

in the periphery of our vision, it stays on the periphery.

12:04

We don't notice and therefore we don't act.

12:09

One day soon after that -- it was a Friday -- at the end of the day,

12:14

I went down -- I was going down to the subway. It was rush hour

12:17

and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs.

12:19

And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs

12:21

I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side,

12:24

shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him --

12:29

hundreds and hundreds of people.

12:31

And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened,

12:35

I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong.

12:39

The moment I stopped, half a dozen other people

12:42

immediately ringed the same guy.

12:44

And we found out that he was Hispanic, he didn't speak any English,

12:46

he had no money, he'd been wandering the streets for days, starving,

12:51

and he'd fainted from hunger.

12:52

Immediately someone went to get orange juice,

12:54

someone brought a hotdog, someone brought a subway cop.

12:57

This guy was back on his feet immediately.

13:00

But all it took was that simple act of noticing,

13:05

and so I'm optimistic.

13:06

Thank you very much.

13:07

(Applause)

Empathy is a crucial skill for everyone working in technology. Well, it’s an important skill that everyone should have but specific emphasis is placed on technology teams since you’re most likely going to have different roles in these teams in the near future.

We’ve learned in the previous lessons that empathy is the ability to understand and relate to the feelings of others. This makes it a crucial skill to be used in building meaningful connections with colleagues you’re going to work with and users who’ll use the awesome technology platforms you’ll build or contribute to.

In order to understand how empathy might impact us in our roles, we need to examine the following hypothetical case study that might be a reflection of the amazing work you’re soon going to be doing.

==1. Human-centered design (HCD):== Also called user-centered design, this is a term you’re likely going to see countless times in your tech career. When you understand the pain points, preferences and needs of users, you’re showing empathy to your users and the result is the creation of products/solutions/apps that are intuitive, user-friendly, and enjoyable to use.

Concerning our healthcare app, your team would most likely conduct intensive user research to understand the needs and pain points of people with chronic conditions. This would likely be through interviewing participants or conducting surveys among other user research methodologies we’re going to mention in future learning modules.

In this case, after interviewing potential users of the healthcare app, you learn that many users feel overwhelmed by the complexity of managing their conditions while navigating the public healthcare system which is cumbersome. With this information, you can design the app to be user-friendly, intuitive to use and customizable to each user’s needs.

==2. Collaboration:== while researching, designing, and developing the healthcare app, your team collaborates with insurance providers, healthcare providers, and people with chronic conditions. By listening to their perspectives and feedback, empathy is demonstrated and the result is building trust and creating a supportive community that values diverse voices.

==3. Ethics and integrity:== while developing the healthcare app and integrating feedback provided by your stakeholders, there are ethical considerations that need to be made that particularly affect technology teams. These range from factors such as _data privacy _and _accessibility_ (especially when dealing with healthcare data) to. In your future role in a tech team, you need to advocate for user data protection ensuring that it’s well secured and access appropriately managed.

==4. User feedback:== after launching the app, it’s always good practice to collect feedback and data from your users to improve their experience on the app. It shows empathy to your users that you still care enough about their experience to continue iterating on your app to improve it for the future. You should always respond to feedback with empathy.

By putting yourself in the user’s shoes and understanding their problems, needs, and perspectives, you can design technology that makes a meaningful impact on people’s lives. In summary, empathy is a crucial skill for anyone working in technology. By practicing empathy, you can build user-centered technology solutions, collaborate effectively with colleagues, consider ethical implications, and give, and receive feedback constructively.
