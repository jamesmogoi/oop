whats a preemptive algorithm in os

###### ChatGPT said:

A **preemptive algorithm** (or **preemptive scheduling algorithm**) in an **Operating System (OS)** is a **CPU scheduling method** where the operating system can **interrupt (preempt)** a currently running process to give the CPU to another process with higher priority or better scheduling criteria.

---

### 🧠 **In simple terms:**

Preemptive scheduling means the CPU **doesn’t wait** for a running process to finish — it can **stop** it in the middle and switch to another process when needed.

---

### ⚙️ **How it works:**

- The OS uses a **scheduler** to decide which process should run next.
    
- If a **new process arrives** with a higher priority, or a **time slice (quantum)** expires, the scheduler **takes the CPU away** from the current process.
    
- The preempted process is moved to the **ready queue** to wait for its next turn.
    

---

### 🧩 **Examples of Preemptive Scheduling Algorithms:**

1. **Round Robin (RR):**
    
    - Each process gets a small time slice (e.g., 10ms).
        
    - When the time is up, it’s preempted and the next process runs.
        
2. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):**
    
    - If a new process arrives with a shorter remaining time than the current one, the current one is preempted.
        
3. **Priority Scheduling (Preemptive version):**
    
    - If a process with higher priority enters, it preempts the running process.
        
4. **Multilevel Queue Scheduling** (preemptive variant):
    
    - Processes can be preempted when switching between queues with different priorities.

### ⚖️ **Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling**

|Feature|Preemptive|Non-Preemptive|
|---|---|---|
|CPU can be taken from a process?|✅ Yes|❌ No|
|Response time|Faster|Slower|
|Complexity|More complex|Simpler|
|Example|Round Robin|First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)|

---

### 💡 **Example Scenario:**

1. Process **P1** is running.
    
2. Process **P2** arrives with **higher priority**.
    
3. OS **preempts P1**, saves its state, and gives CPU to **P2**.

Would you like me to include a **diagram or timeline example** showing how preemption works (like in Round Robin or SRTF)? It makes it very clear visually.

Got it 👍 — this table shows three processes with their **burst time** and **arrival time**:

|Process|Burst Time|Arrival Time|
|---|---|---|
|P1|6 ms|0 ms|
|P2|8 ms|2 ms|
|P3|3 ms|4 ms|

---

Let’s analyze this using a **preemptive scheduling algorithm** example — say **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**, which is the preemptive version of Shortest Job First.

---

### 🧮 Step-by-step (SRTF Scheduling)

#### **At time 0:**

- Only **P1** has arrived → it starts running.
    
- Remaining time of P1 = 6 ms.
    

#### **At time 2:**

- **P2** arrives (8 ms).
    
- Compare remaining times:
    
    - P1 → 4 ms left (since it’s run for 2 ms)
        
    - P2 → 8 ms total  
        → **P1 continues** (shorter remaining time).
        

#### **At time 4:**

- **P3** arrives (3 ms).
    
- Compare remaining times:
    
    - P1 → 2 ms left
        
    - P2 → 8 ms left
        
    - P3 → 3 ms total  
        → **P1** still shortest → continues.
        

#### **At time 6:**

- **P1 finishes.**
    
- Remaining processes:
    
    - P2 → 8 ms
        
    - P3 → 3 ms  
        → **P3** is shorter → runs next.
        

#### **At time 9:**

- **P3 finishes.**
    
- Only **P2** left → runs next.
    

#### **At time 17:**

- **P2 finishes.**

### 🧭 **Gantt Chart**

`| P1 |----| P1 |----| P3 |----| P2 | 0    2    4    6    9    17`

### 🧩 **Turnaround & Waiting Time**

|Process|Arrival|Burst|Completion|Turnaround (C–A)|Waiting (T–B)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|P1|0|6|6|6|0|
|P2|2|8|17|15|7|
|P3|4|3|9|5|2|

---

### ✅ **Averages**

- **Average Turnaround Time** = (6 + 15 + 5) / 3 = **8.67 ms**
    
- **Average Waiting Time** = (0 + 7 + 2) / 3 = **3 ms**
    

---

Would you like me to show the **same data** using a **non-preemptive SJF** to compare how preemption improves response time?

i dont get anything

###### ChatGPT said:

No problem 😊 — let’s slow down and go step by step in very simple terms.

You gave this table 👇

|Process|Burst Time|Arrival Time|
|---|---|---|
|P1|6 ms|0 ms|
|P2|8 ms|2 ms|
|P3|3 ms|4 ms|

---

### 🧠 First — what these mean:

- **Burst time** = how long a process needs the CPU to finish.
    
- **Arrival time** = when the process enters the ready queue (when it starts waiting to use the CPU).
    
- **ms** = milliseconds (just a small unit of time).
    

---

### 🧩 “Preemptive” means

The CPU can **stop a process in the middle** if another **shorter or more important** process arrives.

So we’ll use an example preemptive algorithm called  
👉 **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**.

It means:

> The CPU always runs the process that has the **least remaining time left**.

---

### 🕒 Let’s go time by time:

#### **At time 0**

Only **P1** has arrived → it starts running.  
P1 needs 6 ms total.

#### **At time 2**

**P2** arrives (needs 8 ms).  
Now:

- P1 has already used 2 ms → 4 ms left.
    
- P2 just arrived → 8 ms left.
    

👉 P1 still has less time (4 < 8), so it continues.

#### **At time 4**

**P3** arrives (needs 3 ms).  
Now:

- P1 has 2 ms left.
    
- P2 has 8 ms left.
    
- P3 has 3 ms total.
    

👉 P1 still shortest (2 ms left), so it keeps running.

#### **At time 6**

P1 finishes ✅  
Now P2 (8 ms) and P3 (3 ms) are waiting.  
👉 P3 is shorter, so it runs next.

#### **At time 9**

P3 finishes ✅  
Only P2 left → runs now.

#### **At time 17**

P2 finishes ✅

### 🧱 Gantt Chart (shows CPU timeline)

`|  P1  |  P3  |  P2  | 0      6      9      17`

It means:

- P1 ran from 0 → 6
    
- P3 ran from 6 → 9
    
- P2 ran from 9 → 17
    

---

### 🧮 Final results

|Process|Arrival|Burst|Completion|Turnaround (C–A)|Waiting (T–B)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|P1|0|6|6|6|0|
|P2|2|8|17|15|7|
|P3|4|3|9|5|2|

---

### 📊 Averages:

- **Average Turnaround Time** = (6 + 15 + 5) / 3 = **8.67 ms**
    
- **Average Waiting Time** = (0 + 7 + 2) / 3 = **3 ms**

Would you like me to explain what “turnaround time” and “waiting time” mean too (with an example story, like students waiting for a computer)? It’ll make it much easier to picture.

Perfect 🙌 — glad that clicked!

Now that you understand **preemptive scheduling (SRTF)**, let’s move on to the **next concept** — you can pick which direction you want to go next:

1. ⚖️ **Non-preemptive scheduling** (so you can compare both types side by side — e.g., SJF or FCFS).
    
2. ⏱️ **Round Robin (RR)** — another preemptive algorithm that uses **time slices** (used in multitasking OSes).
    
3. 🧩 **Priority Scheduling** — where each process has a **priority number**, and the CPU chooses the most important one first (can also be preemptive).
    

Which one do you want to learn next?
