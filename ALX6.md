#### THIS ACTIVITY WILL FORM PART OF YOUR WEEK 3 MILESTONE SUBMISSION

We have created a worksheet for Week 3 Milestone; you should use it to complete this activity. You can find the worksheet here: **[Week 3 Milestone Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gq1hbcpgRMkyyAKoZ8vNILcT7Pw3bJVkSKRgY5bOC1c/copy)**. **Save a personal copy** of the worksheet. When you click on the link it will prompt you to create a copy. Click on “Create a Copy” and save the worksheet in your ALX Google Drive folder. Keep the worksheet open in one of your tabs. You will need to refer to it often to complete this activity.

### Scenario

You are part of a tech team that the United Nations has invited to solve issues associated with the Strategic Development Goals (SDGs). A number of the challenges and opportunities confronting Africa require problem statements to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the problem, gaps, impact and potential solutions.

You remember that your alma mater thoroughly engaged you on some of these SDGs as GCGOs. Your manager has no idea where to start in defining the problems and gaps. You tell him about your GCGO lessons, and she excitedly asks you to lead the project. She’s not too concerned about which GCGO you start with; you can pick one that speaks closely to your personal mission.

#### Now that you know the situation, follow the instructions on the worksheet and complete all of Section A.

NOTE: Do not complete PART B of the worksheet as yet. You will return to it after completing the modules on Asking Effective Questions and Web Research.

mandatory

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/f5865018ddac73e42bb695b3b3a22299f74abaa4.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251012%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251012T090117Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=e372067f0ec6800b6b8fd51d8da2e4fd45f55a78f6e163a12ab420cb446b3c8d)

This week, you are required to share your problem statement (from the previous individual activity) with at least 2 peers and receive feedback. You must also give feedback to 2 of your peers’ problem statements. This means you will receive and give constructive feedback before submitting your problem statement as part of your Milestone. You can meet online or in-person at a City Hub to complete this peer activity. This activity will test you in a few areas:

- Your understanding and application of problem-solving techniques.
- Your commitment to ALX Honor Code and ethical leadership.
- Your ability to collaborate, receive and give feedback.
- Your commitment to growth.

---

### General Guidelines

 ==1 -== Find 2 peers in your squad or in person at the hub who are willing to work with you.

==2 -== To share your problem statement with your peers you can do one of the following:

- Invite them as Viewers or Commenters to your Problem Statement Worksheet Google Doc. You will need their email address. (Detailed instructions on how to share **[here](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2494822?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)**), **OR**
- Generate and share the access link to your Google Doc worksheet. **OR**
- Have your peer look at your worksheet on your computer.

==3 -== Each feedback session should not be more than 15 minutes in length – #TimeManagement.

==4 -== That means you will spend at least 1 hour on this activity, to receive 2 pieces of feedback and to give feedback on 2 of your peers’ problem statements.

==5 -== Be kind in your feedback. What you say must be constructive and honest.

==6 -== Try to give and receive feedback from different people but, you can give feedback to the same people who give you feedback. That means a peer can give you feedback and you also give them feedback in return.

==7 -== Remember your commitment to the ALX Honor Code. You cannot copy and submit a peer’s work as your own. If you do that you are breaking ethical expectations and hurting your learning and growth. Be trustworthy and trust your peers to do the same.

---

### Receiving Feedback

 ==1 -== Find 2 peers (one at a time) and share your problem statement with them. Ask for your peers’ full names. You will need to write them down on a Google document and on your worksheet as part of your reflection.

==2 -== Each peer should give you feedback on the following areas:

- Your answers to items #1 to 6 (The 5Ws + H) on the worksheet. Are the answers clear and complete?
- Your answers items #19 and 20 (problem statement & sources). Specifically, does your problem statement:
    - Name the problem succinctly in the first sentence.
    - Indicate the specific population affected?
    - Describe why your problem matters (the impact).
    - Describe what reality would look like if the problem were solved.
- Grammar and any writing errors that you need to correct.

==3 -== Lastly, remember to thank your peer for their feedback and for their time.

---

### Giving Feedback

 ==1 -== Give constructive (helpful and kind) feedback to 2 peers. They can be the same peers who gave you feedback or different peers. Give them feedback in the following areas:

- Their answers to items #1 to 6 (The 5Ws + H) on the worksheet. Are the answers clear and complete?
- Their answers to items #19 and 20 (problem statement & sources). Specifically, does their problem statement:
- Name the problem succinctly in the first sentence.
- Indicate the specific population affected.
- Describe why their problem matters (impact).
- Explain what reality would look like if the problem were solved.
- Grammar and any writing errors that they need to correct.

==2 -== Again, make sure you write down your peers’ full names. You will write them down on your worksheet as part of your reflection.

---

### Self Work

 ==1 -== Update your Answers and Problem Statement in your worksheet to incorporate any useful feedback that you received from your peers. This updated version of your Problem Statement is what you will submit for your Milestone 3.

==2 -== When you have completed your feedback-giving/receiving sessions and problem statement update, take some time to reflect on this exercise before continuing your learning.

---

#### Wishing you all the best in collaborating. Teamwork makes the dream work!

# What You Will Learn

Baseline Google Workspace skills are a must for any tech professional. The apps are increasingly used by organizations and knowing your way around them is a relevant 21st-century skill, which will come in handy in your day-to-day when getting organized, conducting research, preparing reports or coding.

This week we will learn and practice how to use 2 Google Workspace Apps: Sheets and Slides.

For Sheets and Slides, we will be referring back to your personal version of the **[Google Workspace Skills Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qUviVxxwYhBUQFQW9J5wQy7Dcqk7AQOclVKbz4eMFXI/copy)** that you created last week. Open it and keep it close as you will be using the spreadsheet throughout this module.

We will walk you through every step of using the checklist and clearly indicate the skills you are required to have for each app.

#### Ready? Let’s get started!

# Google Sheets: Quick Check

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/f5865018ddac73e42bb695b3b3a22299f74abaa4.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251012%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251012T090304Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=4bcd18b19df48d484020e9a41c27aff7a6602b4c0b5ae1b686433d91ab8c9381)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/639e2aed83b1151237f4a9f98baa8355ca4e064d.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251012%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251012T090304Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=d77c7a1c829e82d52eeec86558ef355b6d244f2e755b34ef8d5878ef615bd2ad)

  
Data entry, data analysis and financial calculation are just some of the tasks that require the use of spreadsheets. Additionally, spreadsheets are an important tool for IT professionals as they use spreadsheets to upload features, document aspects of their program or perform calculations.

Google Workspace is like the ABC of the Tech World. Wouldn’t it be weird to know how to write complex code, but not know how to sort a row in Google Sheets? It is almost like skipping your As and Bs for the Ys and Zs.

It’s a no-brainer that as a tech professional, you need to know how to use spreadsheets. They present many functions that practitioners, programmers, developers and software engineers use in their work. Also, given spreadsheets’ wide use in the workspace, being competent in using them will give you an added professional advantage.

This is your course, and you will get out what you put in!

# [Optional] Google Sheets: Quick Tutorial

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/f5865018ddac73e42bb695b3b3a22299f74abaa4.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251012%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251012T090330Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c3e304136ee195f10c1a3364accba0ca6471f37e68beada4447fa76d0401485a)

  
If you are missing between 1 and 7 skills, start with this quick tutorial.

FOLLOW ALONG. Open up your own Google Sheet, and do what the instructor is doing.

0:00

If you're new to Google Sheets, you're at the right place!

0:02

Today I will help you to start using the tool just in 15 minutes!

## Create a new spreadsheet

0:11

To create a new spreadsheet, go to drive.google.com.

0:14

You need to have an active Google account.

0:17

If you don’t have one, click pause and create it now.

0:20

It takes just a few minutes.

0:23

We are now in our Google Drive.

0:25

It contains folders and files.

0:28

I will create a new Folder by clicking “+ New” on top, and call it “Google Sheets

0:33

for Beginners”.

0:34

Go to folder -> Click “+ New” on top -> Google Sheets -> select whether you want to create

0:40

a blank sheet or use a template.

0:43

For templates, you can either create and upload templates specific for your organization,

0:48

or use Google templates gallery.

0:51

I would prefer to create a blank sheet now.

0:55

One of the coolest tricks with creating a google sheet, is to use “.new”.

0:59

I simply type “sheets.new” in my browser and it creates a new spreadsheet for me!

## Convert uploaded files

1:05

It is automatically saved on my Google Drive.

1:09

Name the sheet in the top left corner to easily find it next time using search in Google Drive.

1:14

To organize it, I click on the folder icon, and here I can either create a new folder

1:20

to store this file, or select an existing one.

1:24

*How to upload an existing spreadsheet* I usually drag and drop excel or csv files

1:28

to the folder on Google Drive.

1:31

To avoid converting each file manually, go to the Settings menu and select “Convert uploaded

1:37

files”.

1:38

Now, any file added to GDrive will be automatically converted without copies.

1:45

If, for some reason, you have an excel or csv file that was not converted, don’t worry

1:50

- it is still readable.

1:52

However, you can only view it.

1:55

Click “Open with Google Sheets” button on top.

1:58

Google will create a Google Sheet copy in the same folder.

2:03

We can now start working with the spreadsheet.

2:06

Let’s go back to our blank spreadsheet.

2:09

Google Drive automatically saves everything, so you don’t have to worry about this.

2:14

Just make sure you are online and this message on top appears.

2:19

There can be a number of sheets in one spreadsheet.

2:22

This is super cool to organize your data.

2:24

I recommend you to keep your raw data, calculations, and dashboards on separate sheets.

## Rename sheets

2:30

Sheets are represented here in the bottom.

2:33

To rename a sheet, double click on it and type the name you want.

2:37

Let’s call this one “Data”.

2:40

To add one more sheet, you click the "plus" here and the new sheet appears.

2:46

If you have several sheets with raw data and with calculations, color coding can be very

2:51

helpful.

2:52

I will color the “Data” sheet purple, and the “Calculations” yellow.

2:56

If you click “All Sheets” button here, you will see the list with color marks, and

3:01

can navigate through them.

3:03

This helps a lot in case you have 10 or 20 sheets in the same file, and they get hidden

3:08

on the right.

3:11

Each sheet has cells, columns and rows.

3:13

Columns are indicated alphabetically, rows are indicated numerically.

3:19

Select the whole column or the whole row by clicking on the index.

3:24

To select the whole sheet, use this button in the top left corner.

3:29

Freeze columns and rows using these markers.

3:31

This is how you can keep the columns and rows headers visible at any time.

3:39

Cells allow you to both store data, and to make calculations based on the data in other

3:44

cells.

3:45

Each cell has an index - this is a combination of the column and the row indexes.

3:51

You will be using the row, column and cell indexes in formulas in the future.

## Input Data

3:58

We can input text, numerical information, dates, currencies.

4:02

To input data in the sheet, click on the cell.

4:05

You can simply type the data right away, or use a field here on the top.

4:11

You can adjust the size of the field.

4:13

But don’t forget to select the correct cell before you use this input field.

4:17

Entering data here is super useful when working with large functions.

## Formatting Data

4:22

Let’s create a simple dataset - information about employees, their age, country of residence,

4:29

and monthly income.

4:30

Let’s freeze the row using this marker.

4:34

Spreadsheet automatically recognizes the type of data you enter.

4:38

However, you can adjust the format manually.

4:41

Use FORMAT to select the type of data you input.

4:46

You can convert your numbers into $, or into % using these buttons in the menu.

4:53

You can decrease or increase decimal places here as well.

4:58

Select the cells you want to apply text formatting to, and design your texts by selecting the

5:05

font, text size, bold, italic, strikethrough, text color etc.

5:11

I will make the headers bold.

5:16

You can manage text wrapping in each cell using this button in the menu.

5:21

You can overflow, wrap or clip text.

5:25

However, for this specific case, I would prefer to resize the columns.

5:31

Color cells to mark the headers, different types of data, or cells containing formulas

5:38

and function outcomes.

## Keyboard Functions

5:41

Select the cells to color, and use the fill color button.

5:46

Watch our video about spreadsheets design, where I will show you how to use color coding

5:51

and conditional formatting.

5:53

Here are some hotkeys and keyboard functions for you to use when working with spreadsheets.

6:00

You can use arrows to move around the sheet.

6:03

For Mac, you can use standard Command+C and Command+V to copy and paste, Command+X to

6:09

cut, Command+Z to undo and so on.

6:12

For PC, use the same combinations, but with a Control.

6:16

An important note: If you copy several cells, the pasted output will contain the same cells

6:22

in the same order.

6:24

Let’s copy names and age.

6:26

We click on the cell to start from to select the range we want.

## Copy Paste

6:31

Command+C, then click on the cell to paste - Command+V.

6:37

The values and the order are saved.

6:40

This might re-write the data, so make sure you paste into empty cells.

6:46

There are different parts of the data that you can copy and paste.

6:49

Copy the set -> right click on the cell to paste values to -> paste special -> select

6:55

what you want to paste.

6:57

For example: Values only - the values will be pasted without

7:02

format.

7:03

Format only - the format will be applied without values, and so on.

7:09

A really cool feature of Google Sheets is to paste transposed.

7:13

If you use it, the data will turn around - what was in the columns will now appear in the

7:18

rows, and vise versa.

7:21

There is a hotkey to select a set - Command+Shift+Direction Arrow for Mac.

7:27

I click on the cell I want to start from, and press Command+Shift.

7:31

If I use the right arrow, it will select all of the cells that contain values on the right.

7:37

If I press it once more, it will select all of the cells in the row.

7:41

Use the left arrow to select the cells with values only.

7:46

Now, we can press Command+Shift+Down, and Google Sheets will expand the selection to

7:52

all of the columns in the set.

7:55

You can select 2 individual cells by holding the Command key for Mac, or Control key for

8:00

PC.

8:03

If you input text and pull the bottom right corner, it will simply copy this text to the

8:08

next cell.

8:09

However, spreadsheet is smart.

8:12

If you input a date, or a day of the week, or a month, select it, drag, and the sequence

8:17

will be expanded.

8:19

The same works for numbers in case you select two of them, and drag the bottom right corner of the

8:25

cell.

## Count Salaries

8:27

Cells allow you to both store data and to make calculations based on the data in the

8:31

other cells.

8:33

Use simple math operators in spreadsheets to make calculations.

8:36

Let’s count the sum of monthly salaries of our employees.

8:41

Add a header first - “Salaries total” I click on the cell, type equality sign, click

8:48

on the cells with salaries and add a plus.

8:52

You can add numbers manually or refer to the cells with values like I did just now.

8:59

Hit Enter and here is the sum of salaries.

9:04

If you want to get an average salary, add a header - “Salaries Average”, type equality

9:10

sign, the sum we’ve counted just now, and divide it by 3.

9:16

If there is a repeatable calculation and you drag the bottom right corner down,

9:21

the spreadsheet will extend the calculation using the values in the new rows.

9:27

Let’s count the annual salary for each of our employees.

9:31

We create a new column, add a header “Annual Salary”.

9:36

Now, we type equality sign, refer to the cell with the monthly salary by clicking on it,

9:43

or typing its cell index and multiplying it by 12.

9:47

Press Enter.

9:49

You can refer to cells in the same sheet, or in a different sheet.

9:54

Moreover, you can refer to a totally different spreadsheet from your GDrive.

9:59

Subscribe to our channel and watch our video about importing data in Google Sheets.

10:04

I can add the number of months to a separate cell and refer to it in the formula.

10:10

I add it to the formula, and hit Enter.

10:13

Now, I drag this formula, and it doesn’t work properly.

10:18

This is because the formula pulls each next cell after the “12 months” one.

10:23

I need the months number to stay the same for all of the copied formulas.

10:28

For this, I can anchor the values inside the formula using the $ sign.

10:32

Put an anchor before the letter to lock this one if formula moves to a new column, and

10:38

add a dollar sign before the number to anchor this value when moving to a different row.

10:43

In our case, we will copy the formula to several new rows, so I need to lock the number.

10:50

Put the dollar sign and press Enter.

10:52

Now, I drag it again and the formula works.

## Functions

10:56

One of the most useful features of Google Sheets is using different functions.

11:02

To use a function, type '=' sign and start typing the name of the function.

11:07

Once you do that, the list of possible functions will pop up, and you can choose one of them.

11:14

You can find a list of quick functions in the menu here.

11:18

Let’s try them!

11:20

Click on the cell, select the function - let’s start from the SUM - then select the

11:25

range to be summed (monthly salaries, for example).

11:29

Hit Enter and here is the result!

11:32

Watch our video about advanced SUM, SUMIF and SUMIFS functions to total values based on

11:39

specific criterion.

11:40

You can calculate the average salary using a function or count the items in the selected

11:45

range.

11:46

You can also display the maximum and minimum value. Follow the same logic: '=' sign, function name, open

11:55

parentheses, add a range, close parentheses, hit Enter.

12:01

There is a huge number of functions in Google Sheets.

12:09

The last but not the least.

12:11

Google Sheets is a great tool for teams to collaborate on data.

12:15

There are several features that allow multiple users to work together in one spreadsheet

12:20

at the same time.

12:22

If you work with your teammates on the same document, but not at the same time, you can

12:27

leave your comments and notes for them.

12:30

Right click on the cell, and insert a comment or a note.

## Comments

12:34

The notes pop up if you hover over the cell.

12:38

Notes are used to add descriptions to the data in the cells.

12:41

You can leave explanations and hints for your colleagues in notes.

12:46

Comments are actionable.

12:48

You can see who is the author of the comment, reply, ask questions, tag users,

12:54

and even have a dialog on the issue.

12:56

You can mark people who should take actions on this comment by typing '+' and an email of

13:02

the person.

13:04

They will get notified by email and any other integrated tool (we use Slack, for example).

13:10

Comments are often used for tasks tracking.

13:13

Once the issue is fixed, the author should mark the comment as resolved.

13:18

today I'm going to talk about how to do

0:03

a simple bar graph using Google sheets

0:06

what you should know is that each of

0:08

these columns are going to represent

0:11

each of your bars so the first thing you

0:15

want to do is decide what the name of

0:17

each bar is what is it that you were

0:19

measuring so if I were graphing I color

0:22

in students I would title each bar R if

0:30

an eye color Row two is going to be how

0:37

large each bar should be so what was the

0:39

data for each of these measurements so

0:42

this in this case it would be number of

0:43

students when all of my data is in I

0:53

highlight all of the cells that I use

0:57

and then I come over here to my insert

1:00

chart button Google should recognize

## Customize Column Chart

1:04

that this is all bar graph data but if

1:07

for some reason it doesn't just come

1:09

over to this option and choose your

1:12

column chart then you can click

1:14

customize the first part of this menu

1:18

will allow you to change the background

1:19

color and the font it will also allow

1:22

you to make this three dimensional or

1:24

keep it two-dimensional whatever you

1:26

prefer for chart and axis titles I

1:31

always recommend it defaults to chart

1:34

title I always recommend starting with

1:36

the axis titles so my horizontal axis is

1:40

going to be my x axis and the title I

1:43

want to give it its what data is

1:47

represented on it so these are my eye

1:49

colors if this data is something that

1:52

you measured in parentheses you want to

1:54

put the unit that you use in this case I

1:59

don't need to do that because eye color

2:01

doesn't have a unit now I can switch

2:04

this to vertical access and that's going

2:06

to be my y-axis

2:12

and again if there's a unit that you

2:16

used if you were measuring in

2:18

parentheses you would put the unit in

2:22

this case I don't have a unit so I'm

2:25

going to leave that like now I can come

2:29

to chart title when I'm making a title

2:33

for my graph I have to represent the

2:37

information that's on the X X Y axis and

2:39

the information that's on the x axis for

2:43

this data I was also graphing just

2:44

eighth grade students so children we

2:58

change this eye color of these grade

3:01

students so now in this title I've

3:04

represented my x axis I've represented

3:08

my Y axis and I've given a little bit

3:10

more information by including that these

3:12

were eighth graders and down here I can

3:16

change the formatting the font the

3:18

format the color and the size of that

3:21

text under series this is where you can

## Customize Bar Chart

3:26

change the color of your bars if you

3:28

choose to this is a simple bar graph so

3:33

there is no legend so I don't need to

3:36

use that under horizontal axis I can

3:38

again change the formatting of my x axis

3:41

font under vertical axis I can change

3:45

the formatting of my Y axis thoughts and

3:48

gridlines I'm not going to play with

3:50

gridlines are these lines that show up

3:52

in the background and I'm happy with how

3:53

these are represented so at this point

3:57

I'm done with my graph and I can come

4:01

over here I can copy my chart and I can

4:05

go to whichever document I need to paste

4:07

it into and I can paste it now this is

4:12

going to offer me the option to either

4:14

link it or unlink it I always recommend

4:17

linking because if I come back here and

4:23

I decide

4:25

I want to update this now I can come

4:33

back here and you'll see a little Update

4:35

button has popped up and when I click it

4:38

it will automatically update it and it

4:40

will only do that if you've linked the

4:42

spreadsheet and that is making a simple

4:46

bar graph using Google sheets

#### 32 Incredible Useful Things You Didn’t Know Google Sheets Could Do

_There’s much more to Google Sheets than meets the eye. Unlock these advanced options–and watch your productivity soar._

#### BY JR RAPHAEL

I’ll admit it: For the majority of my adult life **[spreadsheets](https://www.fastcompany.com/90619659/grid-excel-google-sheets-interactive-web-chats-presentations?partner=rss&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&utm_content=rss)** have remained shrouded in mystery. I’ve used them plenty, of course—to track **[income](https://www.fastcompany.com/90720270/guaranteed-income-and-baby-bonds-could-be-key-to-ending-poverty-in-california?partner=rss&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&utm_content=rss)**, compare statistics, and even maintain databases for various types of work-related info—but I’ve always felt like I’ve barely been scratching the surface of what they’re able to do.

And that’s a shame. With **[Google Sheets](https://www.fastcompany.com/90716633/how-i-recreated-wordle-in-google-sheets?partner=rss&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&utm_content=rss)** in particular, sticking only to spreadsheet basics seems akin to sitting on a mountain of untapped potential. The service has a profusion of advanced functions, options, and shortcuts, but until you identify and internalize them, you’re getting only a fraction of the value it can provide.

So after all these years, I decided to take action. I dug deep into Sheets’ darkest nooks and crannies to uncover some of its most useful and easily overlooked features. Whether you’re a casual spreadsheet explorer or a more ambitious data-crunching pro, I’d be willing to wager there are plenty of worthwhile possibilities just waiting for you to discover, too.

  

Read on, and get ready to take your Google Sheets experience to a whole new level. While some of these items will also work in the Sheets’ mobile apps, the instructions 

below are all for the service’s web version.

As part of this program (and during your career), you will be asked to create presentations using Slides. Sometimes Slides are shared in the same ways Docs are– simply as a way of communicating information, but often with more images and less text. Sometimes Slides are created to accompany an actual presentation; where you or your client/boss will be speaking to others, and the slides serve as support.

Please head over to **your copy** of the Google Workspace **[Skills Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qUviVxxwYhBUQFQW9J5wQy7Dcqk7AQOclVKbz4eMFXI/copy)**, and go to the tab labelled “G-Slides”. Then, go down the list of skills, one by one through each skill item and change column B to “yes” for each skill that you already have and feel confident with.

By the end of this week, you are required to know how to do every skill that is listed as “Essential.” You are not required to master the intermediate or advanced skills, however we encourage you to try to learn them too!

Based on your self-assessed results, here is what you need to do next.

- ==If you’re missing more than 5 essential skills== you will need to commit to spending time learning and practising. Start by watching and following along with the **[17 Minute Tutorial](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/107838)**.
    
- ==If you are missing between 1 - 5 essential skills==, you may want to start by watching and following along with the **[Quick Tutorial](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/107837)**. You can then follow up on specific skills you’re still rusty on by clicking on the associated resource links (provided in the G-Slides tab of your Google Workspace Skills Checklist).
    
- ==If you’ve got all the essential skills on lock already==, hooray! You’re good to go on the Google Slides requirement for this week. But we invite you to grow even further, and to consider boosting yourself even higher by learning all of the intermediate skills!
    
- ==Already know all the intermediate skills?== Wow! We’re very impressed! Then please, aim to reach your personal best and learn the advanced skills.

Let’s practice questioning now. Here’s what you need to do:

==Step 1:== In this **[worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b_CNmjljYoIGGjU7s2bQrnNZQ_15KHqI4NKATKcl4XY/copy)**, you will find 5 scenarios. Please make a personal copy of the sheet, by clicking the “Make a Copy” button when prompted.

==Step 2:== Your task is to write down as many questions as you can about each scenario on the sheet, and identify what type of question each one is.

==Step 3:== If you feel that your question does not fit any of the 4 categories (Convergent, Divergent, Evaluative, Provocative), mark it as “other” and tell us more about why you think it doesn’t fit.

==Step 4:== Focus on asking as many questions as possible - at least 10 per scenario.

### THIS ACTIVITY WILL FORM PART OF YOUR WEEK 3 MILESTONE SUBMISSION.

We are continuing with the scenario that you used to draft your **[problem statement](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/101745)** earlier. Here is the scenario again.

### Scenario Recap

You are part of a tech team that the United Nations has invited to solve issues associated with the Strategic Development Goals. A number of the challenges and opportunities confronting Africa require problem statements to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the problem, gaps, impact and potential solutions.

You remember that your alma mater thoroughly engaged you on some of these SDGs as GCGOs. Your manager has no idea where to start in defining the problems and gaps. You tell him about your GCGO lessons, and she excitedly asks you to lead the project. She’s not too concerned about which GCGO you start with; you can pick one that speaks closely to your personal mission.

Now that you’ve learned a little bit about crafting an “effective question”, let’s put this to the test!

 ==1 -== Open your personal copy of the **[Week 3 Milestone Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gq1hbcpgRMkyyAKoZ8vNILcT7Pw3bJVkSKRgY5bOC1c/copy)**. You should already have completed Section A. Do not create a new copy; use the copy that you created when you completed PART A: Problem Statement. Re-read your problem statement so you remember what it is.

==2 -== We will now be completing Section B of the worksheet.

==3 -== Follow the instructions and identify 3 research questions related to the problem you described in Section A. Your research question must clearly define what you hope to learn/find out. Remember that these questions should follow the principles for effective questions and be open-ended to inspire informative answers. Here are a few things to ask yourself to see if you have a good question:

- Does my question capture a complex issue or problem related to my chosen GCGO?
- Is my question nuanced, with no particular right or wrong answer or easy response?
- Is my question relevant to what is happening in the field? Do multiple stakeholders care about the answer to this question?
- Will I need to do more work to learn more about the factors affecting and influencing this question?

==4 -== **Well done!** That’s it for now. We will discuss in the next module how to conduct effective research so keep your worksheet near as we will come back to it.
