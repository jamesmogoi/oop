#### Not all solutions are mathematical. So don’t worry, this will not be algebra!

Many frameworks and approaches have been developed over the years to help us better solve problems. We want to equip you with crucial problem-solving skills, particularly for your journey in tech, and will share with you two common problem-solving models that we find helpful:

1. The McKinsey Problem Solving Framework
2. Cool Head, Warm Heart Framework

The McKinsey Problem Solving Framework and the Cool Head, Warm Heart Framework are two different approaches to decision-making and problem-solving. While they share some similarities, they differ in focus and application. Let’s take a closer look at each one and when and how to apply them.

# Cool Head, Warm Heart

The Cool Head, Warm Heart Framework is a problem-solving approach that balances analytical and emotional considerations. It involves making decisions that align with one’s values and goals while also considering the perspectives and feelings of others. This framework is often used in interpersonal and social contexts, such as leadership, communication, and conflict resolution. This concept emphasizes the importance of **balancing rationality and empathy in decision-making**.

Having a “cool head” means thinking logically and making decisions based on reason and evidence rather than emotion. It involves staying calm, collected, and composed even in challenging or stressful situations. A cool head is essential for making sound judgments and avoiding impulsive or irrational behavior.

On the other hand, having a “warm heart” means showing kindness, empathy, and compassion towards those impacted by the problem. It involves understanding and caring about people’s feelings and needs, and being able to connect with them on an emotional level. A warm heart is essential for building strong relationships and creating a sense of community.

By combining a cool head with a warm heart, we can make rational and compassionate decisions. We can approach problems with a clear and focused mind, while also being sensitive to the emotions and needs of others.

Explore this concept as part of leadership by reading the following supplementary article. It will help you contextualize the cool head, warm heart approach from a leadership perspective.

For some of us, having a ==“cool head”== is more natural, for others, having a ==“warm heart”== comes easily. _Which one comes more naturally to you?_ Share your thoughts with your peers on eHub, and see what they’re sharing as well!

# Cool Head, Warm Heart Framework

In order to address a real problem and make quality decisions, we first need to understand what factors and considerations we need to make. This involves us applying a ‘cool head’ (a clear rationale) to come up with a good decision as well as a ‘warm heart’ (values) that provide the motivation for tackling the problem in the first place.

The Cool Head, Warm Heart framework has six elements to consider. Let’s talk about each one in more detail.

By incorporating these ==“Cool Head, Warm Heart”== elements when problem-solving, you can make well-informed and thoughtful decisions that are grounded in sound reasoning and values.

# Example: Cool Head, Warm Heart Framework

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/f5865018ddac73e42bb695b3b3a22299f74abaa4.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251012%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251012T085420Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=15e2f188d7670ff2817d0873c9cc1202a7c5f1ceaa6465bbb558d13f3e005348)

Here is an example of a scenario that can make use of the Cool Head, Warm Heart Framework.  
A tech company was facing a challenge with its customer service chatbot. While the chatbot was able to respond to basic customer inquiries, it struggled to understand complex questions and provide personalized responses. As a result, customers were becoming frustrated and the company was experiencing a high rate of customer churn (loss).

  

#### Application of the “Cool Head, Warm Heart” Approach

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/9443c11295d6ae4ca5f2c0b803d082e5904bdb0b.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251012%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251012T085420Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=16bbe6db8ecf0783c9701fc23e67dd4a16fdad0a4342c62e75a3ea150f89e2fc)

In this example, the tech company used the ==“Cool Head, Warm Heart”== model to solve a tech problem by balancing analytical and emotional considerations. By considering both the technical and human aspects of the problem, the company was able to find a solution that improved customer satisfaction and aligned with its values and goals.

#### Okay, now it’s your turn to try it out.

# McKinsey Problem Solving Framework

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/f5865018ddac73e42bb695b3b3a22299f74abaa4.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251012%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251012T085438Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=84588b619cf4ef1402651960c47403870316b0615182373397dfe01baff9cae5)

  
The second problem-solving approach we will explore and practice is McKinsey’s Problem Solving Framework. This framework is often used in business and consulting settings and is particularly effective for analyzing data and developing data-driven and evidence-based solutions. The framework requires that we answer the following 6 questions:

1. What is the problem?
2. Where and when does the problem occur?
3. Who is affected?
4. What will make a solution successful?
5. What are the boundaries of this problem?
6. Who or what can stop you from implementing the solution?

#### Did you notice a lot of similarity with the 5Ws?

Take a look at this template of how the McKinsey Problem Solving Framework is structured:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/eb407416eea5420cf5bba3925a80a8d840cdfaeb.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251012%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251012T085438Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=dcdb36a085458d857f78722c7fbbb32ec0fc983ddcb213acc484046179b2d5b4)

With this framework, you can get a deeper evaluation of your problem from a logical perspective.

# How to Use Problem Solving Approaches

With these 2 frameworks, we have 2 different holistic ways to identify and define problems and then make decisions on how to solve them.

**So how do you decide which approach to use?** Well, in certain situations, one model may work better than others, and it is up to you to determine which one will work best for a given situation based on a few key factors. Here is a general guide:

By this time, you’ve used the problem identified in the last module to explore root causes, define the problem statement and find solutions using the Cool Head, Warm Heart framework. It’s now time to apply the McKinsey Framework on the problem to dig into the causes and find an alternate solution to the problem.
