history depyh of c++ i hear it was made along side unix

C++ wasn't actually made alongside Unix - there's a bit of confusion here with C, which _was_ closely tied to Unix's development.

Let me clarify the history:

**C and Unix (early 1970s):**

- Unix was originally written in assembly language at Bell Labs in 1969
- Dennis Ritchie created C between 1969-1973, specifically to rewrite Unix
- Unix was rewritten in C in 1973, making it one of the first portable operating systems
- C and Unix evolved together at Bell Labs

**C++ (1980s):**

- Bjarne Stroustrup created C++ at Bell Labs starting in 1979
- Initially called "C with Classes" (1979-1983)
- Renamed to C++ in 1983
- First commercial release in 1985

So C++ came about a decade after Unix and C. Stroustrup was inspired by his PhD work with the Simula language and wanted to add object-oriented features to C while maintaining its efficiency. He was working at Bell Labs (the same place where Unix and C were created), so there's definitely a family connection.

The confusion likely comes from the fact that:

- All three (Unix, C, and C++) share Bell Labs heritage
- C++ was designed to be compatible with C
- Unix systems became major platforms for C++ development

C++ has since evolved significantly, with major standards in 1998 (C++98), 2011 (C++11), and continuing through C++23, adding features like templates, smart pointers, lambdas, and much more.

This slide shows the evolution of C++ from its origins through its modern standardization process. Let me break it down:

**Left side - Origins:**

- **Early 1970s**: C language created by Dennis Ritchie (the foundation)
- **1979**: Bjarne Stroustrup starts "C with Classes" - adding object-oriented features to C
- **1983**: Renamed to "C++" (the ++ is the increment operator in C, symbolizing it's an enhancement)
- **1989**: First commercial release - C++ becomes publicly available

**Right side - Standardization Era:**

After years of informal development, C++ needed official standards so code would work consistently across different compilers and platforms:

- **1998 (C++98)**: First official ISO standard - established the baseline for modern C++
- **2003 (C++03)**: Minor update, mostly bug fixes
- **2011 (C++11)**: HUGE update - added auto keyword, lambdas, smart pointers, move semantics, range-based for loops. Often called "Modern C++" starts here
- **2014 (C++14)**: Refinements and small improvements to C++11
- **2017 (C++17)**: Added structured bindings, filesystem library, optional types, and more

The pattern shows C++ moved from ad-hoc development (1979-1998) to a regular standardization cycle, with major releases every 3 years. This ensures the language evolves in a controlled, backward-compatible way while adding modern features developers need.

The standardization is why we say "C++11" or "C++17" - it refers to which standard version you're using.

This slide explains the C++ development process from writing code to running a program. Here's the workflow:

**1. You write instructions (Programming)**

- You create a "recipe" telling the computer exactly what to do
- Written in C++ (a high-level language designed for humans to read and write)
- The code you write is called "source code"

**2. Editor (Writing the code)**

- You use a text editor or IDE (like Visual Studio, VSCode, CLion) to type your code
- C++ programs use two main file types:
    - `.cpp` files - contain your actual code implementation
    - `.h` files (headers) - contain declarations and interfaces

**3. Compiler (Translation)**

- Converts your human-readable C++ code into machine code
- Translates from "high-level" (C++) to "low-level" (binary/object code)
- Creates `.o` or `.obj` object files
- Checks for syntax errors

**4. Linker (Assembly)**

- Takes your compiled object code
- Links it with other libraries (like the C++ standard library, or third-party libraries)
- Combines everything into a single executable program
- Creates the final `.exe` (Windows) or binary file (Linux/Mac)

**The Flow:**

```
Source Code (.cpp/.h) 
    → Compiler → 
Object Code (.o/.obj) 
    → Linker → 
Executable Program (.exe)
    → Run!
```

This is why C++ is called a "compiled language" - it needs this compilation step before it can run, unlike interpreted languages like Python.
