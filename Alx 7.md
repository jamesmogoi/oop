# Asking Effective Questions

  
When you wrote a problem statement earlier this week, you may have encountered a lack of information and had to ask some questions.

It is really tempting to want to start fixing a problem immediately, but the best solutions are developed after tabling relevant questions and prudently interrogating the problem. **To understand the root cause of a problem, you need to be able to ask the right questions.**

Asking effective questions is an essential step in problem-solving.

Here are some reasons why it’s important:

1. ==Gain information:== Effective questions help you gather specific and detailed information to help you make better decisions and solve problems.
    
2. ==Clarify understanding:== It will help gain insights into a particular subject, clarify a misunderstanding, or challenge assumptions.
    
3. ==Foster critical thinking:== Effective questions require critical thinking skills, which can help develop analytical skills and improve your decision-making abilities.
    
4. ==Build relationships:== When thoughtful questions are asked you show interest and empathy, which can foster a deeper understanding and connection with the team members, clients and users.
    
5. ==Solve problems:== Effective questions will help you identify a problem’s root cause and find potential solutions.
    

In the next few pages, we will learn how to ask effective questions to define a problem and formulate a problem statement.

Now let’s look at four of the different kinds of questions that you could ask:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/2e314f6433ba37318033c4251ac3e8d823fb6912.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251012%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251012T091002Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=a6c090838a496b2bfc71b4f2b96731f723f5f4f320c04c1ff5273fdeb127b4fa)

==Convergent== questions drive toward a specific range of answers.

==Divergent== questions open up unlimited avenues for responses.

==Evaluative== questions encourage deep analysis to answer.

==Provocative== questions evoke an emotional response that may lead to deeper reflection.

Topic Exercise

Time to put those research skills to use. Take some time to go find some examples of each type of question from real life scenarios. These can be interviews, talk shows, research studies, or anything else utilizing questions! Find at least 2-3 examples of each type of question. Share your findings, along with details of scenario or situation in which they were used, with your peers on **[eHub](https://ehub.alxafrica.com)**, and see what they’re sharing as well!

# Effective Problem Solving Questions

#### “Sonar helps dolphins see; questions help people discern.”

Let’s draw some insights from this **[article](https://www.pragmaticinstitute.com/resources/articles/product/problem-solving-its-all-about-smarter-questions/)** by Nilofer Merchant. As you read, make you understand and can articulate:

- What questions matter when trying to solve a problem?
- Examples of powerful questions.

#### Did you catch those example questions?

Powerful questions are the path to clarity. Here are some examples of questions you can use during the inquiry phase to enhance your understanding of the situation:

“What seems to be the trouble?”

“What concerns you the most about _________?”

“What is holding you back from _________?”

“What seems to be your main obstacle to _________?”

Ask customer service: “What makes customers angry enough to contact you?”

Ask sales people: “What is contributing to lost deals?”

Ask product management: “What do you make of _________?”

Ask the channel: “How do you feel about our company’s pricing for _________?”

Ask customers: “What would make this product more appealing?”

To probe deeper, ask these follow-up questions:

“What do you mean by _________?”

“Tell me more about _________.”

“What else?”

“What other ways did you try so far?”

“What will you have to do to get the job done?”

“Is there something I should have asked that you need me to know?”

Engage people to solve the problem. And always, no matter what, ask people how they would solve the problem.

“How do you want _________ to turn out?”

“What do you want?”

“What is your desired outcome?”

“What benefits would you like to get out of X?”

“What do you propose?”

“What is your plan?”

“If you do this, how will it affect _________?”

“What else do you need to consider?”

Earlier we said that to develop a good problem statement you must be able to **first define/identify the correct problem**. You do this by using the 5Ws +H) which we covered in the previous module.

Asking the right questions in the right order will enable you to build an effective – and SMART – problem statement. Questions are important because they allow us to uncover assumptions that we may have about a proposed course of action.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/10/6bc76e57bf22687c6543631df70d80c43bbf0cda.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251012%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251012T091038Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=7c05106656e9d7b8de5af8d3e564b457a83bf4b545a0c1cd3862e1d48a7e1ef4)

#### Here is a recap of the 5Ws (+H) that you must ask to define and identify a problem.

- ==What== is the problem? What is reality like because of this problem? What will the reality be like if the problem continues?
- ==Who== does this problem impact, directly and indirectly? (This could include people and/or animals.) Who contributes to the problem (for example, specific corporations, governments, and/or individuals)?
- ==When== did the problem begin? When does the problem occur? When does it need to be resolved?
- ==Where== is this problem occurring? (And what is the context in which it occurs?)
- ==Why== is the problem happening? Why is it important to solve the problem? (highlight the pain)
- ==How== would the world be different if the problem were solved? How do we solve the problem?

Additional questions (as guided by the elements of a problem statement)

It is likely that after asking these questions there will still be pieces of missing information. This means that you must keep in mind the elements of your problem statement, so you can ask appropriate follow on questions that help you get all the information you need. Remember, the elements of a problem statement that you must have adequate information about include:

- A succinct ==problem description== (a more concise ‘what’ and possibly ‘when’)
- The specific ==population== affected (a more concise ‘who’ and ‘where’)
- The ==impact== of the problem (cost, time, quality, environmental, personal… This is a more concise ‘why’.)
- Identify the ==gap== that exists between present reality and the desired outcome. How would reality look if the problem were solved? (This is a more concise how.)

Okay, let’s take a moment to celebrate you for learning how to ask the right questions to define your problem and draft your problem statement.

_**Look at you taking in all this good wisdom. A big shout-out to your commitment to learning!**_

While we are still in the spirit of questions, let’s talk a little bit about formulating research questions.

Soon you will be a renowned tech guru and to win in the world of tech you must be able to provide viable solutions to clients and users.

Sometimes, when presented with a problem to solve, things are not as straightforward as they seem and you will need to do some digging to find information to formulate solutions. **So how do you know what to dig for and where to start?**

A Research Question begins with ==a research problem== – an issue someone would like to know more about or a situation that needs to be changed or addressed. It is used to analyse, and investigate a topic and is inquisitive in nature.

A properly written question will be ==clear== and ==concise== and should contain the topic being studied (purpose), the applicable variable(s), and the population.

- ==A variable== in research simply refers to a person, place, thing, or phenomenon that you are trying to measure in some way.
    
- ==A research population== refers to the entire group of individuals or objects that a researcher is interested in studying. This could include people, animals, plants, or even inanimate objects such as buildings or artefacts.
    

#### There are three main types of research questions that you can ask:

- ==Causal== – Compares two or more phenomena and determines whether a relationship exists. These are often called relationship research questions.  
    Example: Does the amount of calcium in the diet of elementary school children affect the number of cavities they have per year?
    
- ==Descriptive== – Seeks to describe a phenomenon and often study “how much”, “how often”, or “what is the change”.  
    Example: How often do university-aged students use Twitter?
    
- ==Comparative== – Aims to examine the difference between two or more groups in relation to one or more variables. The questions often begin with “What is the difference in…”.  
    Example: What is the difference in caloric intake between high school girls and boys?
# Creating Hypotheses

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/f5865018ddac73e42bb695b3b3a22299f74abaa4.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251012%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251012T091115Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=a449ff78aa69eeaf9d9884006f0a96bcdc01aab8d654b25084c4489ea6621b45)

  
Once we’ve stated the research question, you will need something else called a hypothesis.

What is a Hypothesis and Why do I Need it?  
A hypothesis is important as it helps you organize and focus your research question and design a study that can answer it. We all form hypotheses every day but we aren’t always aware of it.

**A hypothesis is a tentative prediction – a thought-out guess.**

- It is typically used when significant knowledge already exists on the subject, allowing the prediction to be made.
- Data is then collected, analyzed, and used to support or negate the hypothesis, arriving at a definite conclusion at the end of the research.
- It is always written as a statement and should be developed before any data is collected.

**Here are some examples of hypotheses:**

- Student Life’s _Move program_ will decrease the number of sick days claimed by students.  
    
- Consuming vitamin C supplements will reduce the incidence of the common cold in teenagers.  
    
- The rhino population in Kenya would increase if the international demand for rhino horns decreased.

Reflect:  
Time to dig into your life’s problems again! Think of an issue or nuisance that you face in your day to day. This can be anything like missing the bus, sleeping in late etc. as long as it’s something that happens on a regular basis. Use this to form a hypothesis of why you think it occurs and how you could potentially solve it. Keep this with you as we’ll build on it on the next page.

When conducting some research, the last thing you want are questions to your questions. So let’s talk about some best practices to ensure that your research question is clear from the get-go.

Being able to create well-articulated questions can make or break your research. For clear guidelines on research question best practices, take time to read **[this article](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/writing-resources/research-based-writing/how-to-write-a-research-question)** from The Writing Center. As you read, make a note of:

1. The characteristics of good research questions.
2. The process to follow when creating a research question.
