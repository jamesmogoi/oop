# GCGOs: An Even Closer Look

You have just gone through 4 more GCGOs, and we commend your effort and dedication. In this module, we’ll explore the remaining 7 together: Women Empowerment, Education, Tourism, Infrastructure, Arts, Culture and Design, Governance and Natural Resources. We share these big challenges and opportunities with you to inspire you to think big about your purpose and how you can make an important difference in this world! As you learn more about each of these 7 GCGOs think about:

1. Why each area is labelled a challenge or opportunity?
2. The role that tech is playing in bringing solutions and change.

Reflect:  

Now that you’ve covered GCGOs and have a better understanding of what they are, think about the following questions:

- At first glance, how much does each GCGO resonate with me?
- What do I want to accomplish and contribute to society?
- What challenges/opportunities feel most interesting and important to me?
- In what ways (big or small) might I creatively weave my career and societal contribution (or GCGO of choice) together over the next year?
- What resources can I explore to learn more about merging my path in tech with the GCGO that resonates the most with me?

#### There has been notable progress in the space and a lot must still be done.

In December 2024, Forbes.com released a list of the **[World’s Most Powerful Women](https://www.forbes.com/lists/power-women/)** which hopefully is inspirational to us all. You will note that only a few African nationalities are represented on the list. This is another reminder that a lot still needs to be done to empower women on the African Continent.

ALX Africa is another organization committed to addressing this continental plight. One way they are helping close the gender gap is through the Women in Tech Initiative which equips women to lead careers in a historically male-dominated industry.

#### Technology is once again unearthing solutions to the education challenges in Africa.

1. The government of Rwanda has implemented a technology-led initiative called RwandaEQUIP. The transformative program is making the country’s basic education system globally competitive. Underpinning RwandaEQUIP is a data-driven technology where teachers are supported with tablets to deliver customized lesson plans optimized for students and provide a feedback loop. Without technology, measuring and driving improvement in this way would be impossible.

2. This works hand-in-hand with NewGlobe and links to an organization well known for supporting national governments in creating powerful technology-enabled education systems.

3. In southern Nigeria, the EdoBEST education transformation program has been running since 2018 in Edo state. This, and other programs in Kenya, Liberia, Lagos and Kwara states in Nigeria, are all based on the NewGlobe technology-based education systems.

4. ALI graduates are also applying their skills to solve the education challenges on the continent. Farai Mujoma, ex-deputy Chief of Staff to Fred Swaniker, is the founder of Shasha, an educational network whose Moonshot is to provide a one-stop shop for all the on-demand digital education needs in Africa.

Take a look at this short video and as you watch ask yourself:

1. How is Shasha maximizing tech tools to simplify learning and increase access to information for both teachers and students?
2. What notable difference has Shasha made in their user’s education journey?

**Ahh, yes!** We all dream of going to a happy place where we indulge in new experiences, savour new dishes, and immerse ourselves in a different culture. Our vacations, holidays and short road trips reinvigorate us while, on the other hand, they create, jobs, income and economic opportunities for the communities that serve us.

Take a moment to read **[the short article below](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/competitiveness/brief/tourism-and-competitiveness)** that sheds light on Tourism as an opportunity for developing countries.

#### Article Excerpt

The tourism sector is a vital engine for economic growth and social development in developing countries, creating inclusive jobs, especially for **women**, fostering **innovative businesses**, and funding **natural** and **cultural** heritage conservation. The **World Bank** supports sustainable tourism because it significantly boosts revenue, stimulates small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), improves community well-being, and prevents environmental degradation.

Globally, tourism’s economic impact is substantial: in 2024, it contributed **US$10.9 trillion** to global GDP, representing **10% of the world economy**. The sector also supported an impressive **357 million jobs worldwide**, meaning approximately one in every ten jobs, underscoring its critical role in the global labor market. This robust activity was further fueled by a surge in international visitor spending, which reached US$1.9 trillion.

However, realizing tourism’s full potential demands careful management to mitigate social and environmental risks. The World Bank’s approach involves a “**Tourism Economy Impact Framework**” to manage the interplay of demand, supply, and assets, and a “**Tourism Theory of Change**” that identifies challenges and effective policy interventions to achieve outcomes like increased visitor spending and job creation. Successful projects in Indonesia, Madagascar, Sierra Leone, and Pakistan demonstrate tourism’s power to drive private investment, create jobs, and foster sustainable development.

These projects highlight the World Bank’s commitment to maximizing tourism’s positive impacts while addressing its inherent complexities. By focusing on both economic returns and sustainable practices, the WB aims to ensure that tourism serves as a long-term catalyst for development, benefiting local communities and preserving valuable assets for future generations. Their efforts underscore the belief that thoughtful investment and strategic planning can transform tourism into a powerful force for good.

Key benefits of sustainable tourism:

- **Economic Empowerment**: Especially for women.
- **Job Creation**: Across diverse sectors.
- **Environmental Protection**: Through funding and responsible practices.
- **Community Well-being**: Improving livelihoods and social benefits.

Okay, you know the drill by now. Let’s explore the next important question: **How is tech leveraging this grand opportunity?**

Take a moment to watch this video and ask yourself:

- How is technology disrupting the tourism space?
- What is eTourism?
- What are the differences between eTourism vs Virtual Tourism vs Smart Tourism?

Okay, now that you know the benefits that tourism can bring and tech’s defining role, we can give ourselves permission to dream a little.

Reflect:  

In 1 - 2 sentences, share the following with your squad, on **[eHub.](https://ehub.alxafrica.com)**

1. The one place you want to visit and indulge in progressive technology. This can be any place e.g. a company, city or country.
2. What recent technologies are a must-have when on holiday? An example is: The destination must support eSIM.

# Global Opportunity: Arts, Culture, & Design

Cultural and creative industries, which include arts and crafts, advertising, design, entertainment, architecture, books, media and software, have become a vital force in accelerating human development. They empower people to take ownership of their own development and stimulate the innovation that can drive inclusive sustainable growth. If well-nurtured, the creative economy can be a source of structural economic transformation, socio-economic progress, job creation and innovation while contributing to social inclusion and sustainable human development.

Reflect:  

Take a moment to look around you, your community and your city and ask yourself:

- Do African creatives have access to the same platforms as those who create in other regions of the world?
- What could be done differently to promote art, culture, and design talent in our communities?
- How can tech be adapted to empower the Global South Arts, Culture, and Design industries?
- How might artists/designers on the Continent take advantage of NFT art to further their work and propel local economies?

Share you thoughts with your peers on **[eHub](https://ehub.alxafrica.com)**, and see what they’re sharing as well!

What is NFT art?  
NFT art is digital art that is tokenized in the blockchain. The artwork is entirely digital, meaning that investors ultimately buy, sell and trade in the metaverse. Just like there is only one original with physical art, NFT art only has one original. Even though it is relatively easy to copy with downloads and screenshots, only the original holds the unique value.

What is Blockchain?  
Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

Do you see? There is a whole world of tech platforms that are changing the way we produce and interact with art and design.

We will stop here for now lest we get carried away and find ourselves down a metaverse rabbit hole.


# Global Challenge: Infrastructure

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2024/7/f5865018ddac73e42bb695b3b3a22299f74abaa4.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20251009%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251009T152232Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=895d601a3b4294aeb9be00ef348e296c7288370acf1b5e60c5801c4adfe5666c)

What do you think “infrastructure” refers to? Most people think it’s just roads and bridges. Well, most people would be wrong.

What is Global Infrastructure?  
Global infrastructure refers to a set of facilities and systems that serve a country, city, or other areas. It encompasses the services and facilities necessary for its economy, households and firms to function.

These facilities include sanitation and waste management systems, water, mining, telecoms, media & technology, transport, and environmental and municipal infrastructure. As the global warming alarm bells ring louder, the world’s governing bodies are searching for and developing sustainable and “green” solutions to infrastructural systems worldwide.

Several AL alumni are at the forefront of answering that plight and are contributing to building sustainable infrastructure in several of these areas. AL alumni Spencer Horne is connecting remote areas to the rest of the world through his startup called Coudline. As the name suggests, Cloudline uses carbon emission-free drone technology to deliver medical supplies and food parcels to remote areas that would normally not be reached through conventional transport lines.

Let’s learn about Cloudline through this short video. **Ask yourself as you watch:**

1. How is Cloudline leveraging technology to increase access and raise the standard of everyday life in the world’s most isolated areas?
2. Do you consider Cloudline’s offering as innovative technology being used to meet a long-standing need? Why or why not?

0:15

- [Audience members] Kia ora.

0:16

- My mountain is Table Mountain, which rises out of the sea

0:20

where the Atlantic and Indian Oceans meet.

0:23

My name is Spencer Horne.

0:26

I'm from Cape Town, South Africa.

0:28

I was born and raised there by a single mom

0:33

in modest circumstances, but through

0:36

her sacrifices and a great deal of luck,

0:40

I was afforded educational opportunities

0:44

that would allow me to escape

0:46

what one might call postal code determinism.

0:49

(chuckles from audience)

0:54

Growing up in South Africa in a deeply divided society,

0:59

I was always fascinated by the structural drivers

1:03

behind inequity and poverty, and became passionate

1:08

about addressing those at their root.

1:12

And it was the sensitization

1:15

to structural inequality

1:18

that I carried with me along my path, which took me,

1:22

via engineering school in the US,

1:25

to East Africa in 2016,

1:28

where I was working in a management consulting role

1:32

and visiting markets across the country.

1:36

And I became, in my travels right across Kenya

1:40

and into Uganda, sometimes off of the beaten path,

1:45

keenly aware of a problem that I'd known about

1:48

and acknowledged, but never truly understood.

1:52

And that was just how bad transportation infrastructure

1:56

can be in many places, and how it acts

1:59

as a structural barrier to development in those places.

2:05

And it turns out this is not a local problem.

2:09

There are more than a billion people in the world today

2:11

who have no direct access to paved roads and runways.

2:16

Their lives are fundamentally different from our own.

2:20

They live in remote regions, they live in island nations,

2:24

and in disaster-stricken areas, sometimes disasters

2:27

that have been going for decades.

2:30

What struck me most about being there

2:34

and finally being able to empathize

2:36

with the problem in an authentic way, was that

2:41

I wasn't convinced we'd really been working on solving it.

2:45

It's been known for a very long time.

2:47

We've had this issue for decades

2:50

in many developing communities across the world,

2:53

but what are we truly doing towards addressing that?

2:58

And this is where I became very, very interested

3:01

in work that was being done with UAVs and drone delivery,

3:05

and looking at their application

3:07

to reach marginalized communities.

3:09

But they have, a couple of issues,

3:12

but one of the big issues faced in drone delivery today

3:16

is the payload that can be carried

3:18

and how far it can be carried.

3:20

Just what can we get out to people?

3:23

And it all hinges on battery efficiency.

3:27

So I started thinking about this problem

3:29

and how we might overcome it, and I wondered,

3:32

might we use helium balloons

3:36

to do the heavy lifting?

3:38

So now our lift energy is free

3:41

and we can carry a great deal more.

3:44

It can carry more batteries and we can get further.

3:48

So could we use autonomous airships

3:51

to reach these marginalized communities?

3:54

Some of you know airships as blimps,

3:57

and I've got a picture of one here.

3:59

This is a lot bigger than the current target

4:03

that Cloudline is looking at,

4:07

but as you can see, it isn't made

4:08

of cow intestines like the Zeppelins were.

4:12

So we've had a couple of modern advances,

4:15

but really the big enabler is the cheap technology

4:18

that is coming out of the UAV world, that allows us

4:21

to navigate and propel these devices in a precise way today,

4:26

in a way that could not be done before,

4:27

and to do them at a much smaller scale

4:29

than could have been done before.

4:33

But most important to me, the takeaway from my work

4:36

on this project so far, is the fact that

4:38

although the humanitarian use cases are the most pressing,

4:43

and the most promising in terms of an ensure business case,

4:47

people in these communities are not just a charity case.

4:51

They are very real markets.

4:53

There are a billion people out there

4:56

that represent a very real market,

4:58

that want the consumer goods that we have every day

5:01

and don't want to pay double the price

5:04

just because they don't live in a city the way we do.

5:07

I'll be hosting a breakout session this afternoon

5:10

for those of you who want to chat a little bit more

5:12

and find out more detail.

5:15

Thank you very much.

To speak to these two GCGOs we are sharing articles that:

1. Debate the governance loopholes we have on the African continent.
2. Highlight the economic empowerment that can be realized by communities when natural resources are applied ethically for the greater good.

Read carefully, and share your thoughts with your peers on **[eHub](https://ehub.alxafrica.com)**.

- All right, take a time out from your scroll for one minute

0:03

and let's do a little meditation together.

0:05

So first thing, let yourself be comfortable,

0:08

whether you're sitting or you're standing.

0:10

It might be nice to take a couple deep breaths.

0:13

(inhaling)

0:15

And let 'em out.

0:17

(exhaling)

0:17

You can relax your shoulders, face,

0:19

maybe even your belly as well.

0:24

Feel as much sensation as you can throughout your body.

0:29

You might also notice that there's sounds

0:30

happening around you and a stream of thoughts moving

0:34

through the mind, just let it all happen.

0:37

(soft relaxing music)

0:40

And if you like, think about something in your life

0:43

that you really care about.

0:46

(soft relaxing music)

0:54

You might feel a sense of gratitude.

0:57

(soft relaxing music)

1:03

Then take a deep breath in.

1:05

(inhaling)

1:06

One more easy out breath.

1:08

(exhaling)

1:10

If your eyes were closed you can open them.

1:13

See how you feel.

1:15

And then go on with your the rest of your day.

1:17

Hope you enjoy it.
